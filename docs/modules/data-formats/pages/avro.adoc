:description: Work with Avro data in {short-product-name}

== Read and write Avro

{short-product-name} can read and write data using https://avro.apache.org/[Avro].

To declare that a type should be read as CSV, add the `lang.taxi.formats.AvroMessage` annotation to a model:

[,taxi]
----
import lang.taxi.formats.AvroMessage

@AvroMessage
closed model People {
  name: Name
  id: sId
  email: Email?
  phones: Phones[]
  last_updated: LastUpdated
}
----

When writing Avro, serialization order is important. Therefore, you should also specify the field order using an `AvroField` annotation:

[,taxi]
----
import lang.taxi.formats.AvroMessage
import lang.taxi.formats.AvroField

@AvroMessage
closed model People {
  @AvroField(ordinal = 0) name: Name
  @AvroField(ordinal = 1) id: Id
  @AvroField(ordinal = 2) email: Email?
  @AvroField(ordinal = 3) phones: Phones[]
  @AvroField(ordinal = 4) last_updated: LastUpdated
}
----

Any requests or responses sent to/from systems where the model type has been annotated with `@AvroMessage` will be
serialized using Avro.

== Add Taxi types to Avro

Just like all schemas in {short-product-name}, Taxi types are required to indicate how data is linked and relates between systems.

To add Taxi metadata to your Avro file, use the `taxi.dataType` attribute.
Here's an example assigning a Taxi type name to a record / object:

[,json5]
----
{
  "type": "record",
  "namespace": "simple",
  "name": "AddressBook",
  // without this annotation, a type of simple.AddressBook would have
  // been created, based off the namespace and name
  "taxi.dataType": "com.example.AddressBook",
  "fields": [
    //... continues ...
  ]
}
----

Or, to define a Taxi type for a field:

[,json5]
----
 {
  "type": "record",
  "name": "Person",
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "name",
      "type": "string",
      "taxi.dataType": "foo.PersonName"
    },
    {
      "name": "id",
      "type": "int",
      "taxi.dataType": "foo.PersonId"
    }
    // ... continues ...
  ]
}
----

If a schema does not define / expose Taxi types for fields, {short-product-name} will assign them automatically.

For records, the `namespace` and `name` are used to infer the type name.
For fields, a type is created based off the field name, and the `type`, which defines the underling primitive type.

== Add Avro projects to your workspace

Schemas declared in Avro can be added to your workspace by either editing your workspace file (normally `workspace.conf`),
or through the UI.

=== Use the workspace file

==== Local file projects

You can add Avro schemas that are present locally on the file system of the server by adding the following declaration to your `workspace.conf` file:


[,hocon]
----
file {
    projects=[
        {
            loader {
                // All projects in {short-product-name} require a unique identifier
                identifier {
                    id="com.hazelcast/avro-test/1.0.0"
                    name=avro-test
                    organisation="com.hazelcast"
                    unversionedId="com.hazelcast/avro-test"
                    uriSafeId="com.hazelcast:avro-test:1.0.0"
                    version="1.0.0"
                }
                // set the packageType to Avro
                packageType=Avro
            }
            packageIdentifier {
                name=avro-test
                organisation="com.hazelcast"
                version="1.0.0"
            }
            // The path on your local machine to the avro schema
            path="/opt/resources/avro/addressBook.avsc"
        }
    ]
}
----

==== Git projects

You can add Avro schemas that are present within a Git repository by adding the following declaration to your `workspace.conf` file:

The Git repo is monitored, so any changes are pulled locally and automatically applied inside of {short-product-name}.


[,hocon]
----
git {
    repositories=[
        {
            branch=main
            loader {
                identifier {
                    id="com.avro.git/avro/1.2.3"
                    name=avro
                    organisation="com.avro.git"
                    unversionedId="com.avro.git/avro"
                    uriSafeId="com.avro.git:avro:1.2.3"
                    version="1.2.3"
                }
                packageType=Avro
            }
            name=test-project
            // The path to the avro file within your Git repository
            path="/addressBook.avsc"
            // The url of your git repo
            uri="https://gitlab.com/acme/my-avro-project.git"
        }
    ]
}
----

=== Use the UI

You can load Avro schemas into your workspace using the UI.

Start by navigating:

* Projects > Add Project

image:add_project_avro_flow_2.png[]

* Then select to add a project from either a Git Repo or Local disk

==== Add an Avro project from Git

This workflow lets you add a reference to an Avro schema that's checked into a Git repository.

The Git repo is monitored, so any changes are pulled locally and automatically applied inside of {short-product-name}.

* Provide the URL of the Git repository, and click *Test Connection*
 ** If the test was successful, repository name and branch are populated for you
* Set the project type to *Avro*
* Set the path to the location of your Avro schema within the repo
* Provide a unique package identifier for this Avro schema

image:add_avro_git_repo_flow.png[]

==== Add an Avro project from a file

This workflow lets you add a reference to an Avro schema that's already local on the server.

Any changes made to the file are automatically detected, and updated inside of {short-product-name}.

NOTE: 'Local' means local to the server.

This workflow adds a reference to an Avro file that's *on the disk of the server*. +
 +
It's intended for developers who are running {short-product-name} in a container on their local machine. +
 +
This workflow isn't intended for uploading an Avro schema to a remote server. Instead, use a Git repository

* Set the project type to *Avro*
* Provide the path on your local machine to where the Avro file is
* Provide a unique package identifier for this Avro schema

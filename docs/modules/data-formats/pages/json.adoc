:description: Working with JSON data in {short-product-name}.


JSON is the default format for reading/writing data to/from {short-product-name}, so requires no special customization.

== Using jsonPath() references

WARNING: Using the `by jsonPath()` tag is deprecated. Field names in the model are now used to match elements and attributes.

It's possible (but discouraged) to use `by jsonPath("")` references to declare a field:

[,taxi]
----
model Person {
  firstName : FirstName by jsonPath("$.fName")
}
----

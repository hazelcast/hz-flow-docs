= Custom data formats in {short-product-name}
:description: 'Custom data formats in {short-product-name}'


{short-product-name} has support for several data formats, however, if you need a format that's not here, it's possible
to implement your own.

{short-product-name} uses a https://github.com/{short-product-name}api/{short-product-name}/blob/develop/vyne-core-types/src/main/java/com/{code-product-name}/models/format/ModelFormatSpec.kt[ModelFormatSpec] to provide format-specific serialization and deserialization implementations.

While it is possible to define your own custom format, to load it into {short-product-name} currently requires a custom build. This is available for Enterprise customers only.

Support for loading custom formats via Taxi projects is planned.

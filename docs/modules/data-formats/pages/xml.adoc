:description: 'Working with XML data in {short-product-name}'

To declare that a type should be read/written as XML, add the `com.{code-product-name}.formats.Xml` annotation to a model:

[,taxi]
----
import com.{code-product-name}.formats.Xml

@Xml
model Person {
  firstName : FirstName inherits String
}
----

== Declaring attributes

By default, scalar items within a model are expected to be an XML element.

To declare something should be read/written as an attribute, use the `@lang.taxi.xml.XmlAttribute` annotation.

For example:

[,taxi]
----
  import com.{code-product-name}.formats.Xml
  import lang.taxi.xml.XmlAttribute

  @Xml
  model Actor inherits Person {
      @XmlAttribute
      id : ActorId

      fullName : FullName
  }
----

Would read/write the following XML:

[,xml]
----
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<Actor id="3">
    <fullName>Jimmy Smith</fullName>
</Actor>
----

== Collections

Collections are indicated by a repeating group with the attribute name.

For example:

[,taxi]
----
  @Xml
  model Movie {
   actors : Actor[]
  }
----

Would expect a repeated `actors` element:

[,xml]
----
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<Movie>
    <actors id="1">
        <firstName>Mel</firstName>
        <lastName>Gibson</lastName>
    </actors>
    <actors id="2">
        <firstName>Jack</firstName>
        <lastName>Spratt</lastName>
    </actors>
</Movie>
----

== Expressions

Expressions can be declared on a model.

=== Serializing

Expression values are written out as normal elements.

=== Deserializing

If an element or attribute is present for the field where the expression is declared,
the expression is ignored, and the value from the source is taken.

If there's no value present, then the expression is evaluated.

[,taxi]
----
import com.{code-product-name}.formats.Xml
import lang.taxi.xml.XmlAttribute

@Xml
model Actor {
    firstName : FirstName inherits String
    lastName : LastName inherits String
    fullName : FullName inherits String = FirstName + ' ' + LastName
}
----

Given the following XML:

[,xml]
----
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<Actor id="3">
    <firstName>Jimmy</firstName>
    <lastName>Smith</lastName>
</Actor>
----

Then the value is read as:

[,json]
----
{
  "firstName" : "Jimmy",
  "lastName" : "Smith",
  "fullName" : "Jimmy Smith"
}
----

== Using xpath() references

WARNING: Using the `by xpath` tag is deprecated. Field names in the model are now used to match elements and attributes. 

It's possible (but discouraged) to use `by xpath("")` references to declare a column:

[,taxi]
----
model Person {
  firstName : FirstName by xpath("//fName")
}
----

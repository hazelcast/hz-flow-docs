:description: 'Working with Protobuf data in {short-product-name}'


Protobuf is supported when using a dedicated Protobuf spec.

Using Protobuf without a spec is technically link:/docs/modules/describing-data-sources/pages/protobuf.adoc#generated-taxi[possible], but discouraged, and not currently supported.

Instead, use a dedicated link:/docs/modules/describing-data-sources/pages/protobuf.adoc[Protobuf] spec.

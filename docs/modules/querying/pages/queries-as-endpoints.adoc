= Publishing queries (http and websockets)
:description: Let consumers invoke your queries as standard HTTP endpoints

You might decide that instead of link:/docs/querying/writing-queries#submitting-queries[submitting queries] directly to {short-product-name}, or using one of our
link:/docs/querying/kotlin-sdk[SDKs] to execute a query programmatically, you'd rather just publish the query as an HTTP(s) endpoint.

== Saved queries

Any queries committed to your taxonomy that have an `@HttpOperation` annotation will automatically be converted into an HTTP query.

For example:

```taxi MyQuery.taxi
@HttpOperation(url = '/api/q/movies/\{movieId}', method = 'GET')
query getMoviesAndReivews(@PathVariable("movieId") movieId: MovieId) {
  given { movieId }
  find {
    title : MovieTitle
    reviewScore : ReviewScore
  }
}

----
Any declared `query` that's in a Taxi project published to {short-product-name} can be converted into an HTTP operation.

### HttpOperation annotation
Queries need to have an `@HttpOperation` annotation:

| Param  | Description                                                                                     |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| url    | The URL the query is exposed under. It *must* start `/api/q`.  Any other query URLs are ignored |
| method | The HTTP method to respond to, one of `GET`,`POST`,`PUT`, or `DELETE`                           |

Variables can be defined in your path using `{myVar}`, which are then made available in your query declaration using a `@PathVariable` annotation.

<Callout type="note" title="Heads up!">
  For security reasons, queries are only exposed under the <code>/api/q</code> endpoint. Any queries where URL in the <code>@HttpOperation</code> annotation starts with something other than <code>/api/q</code> are ignored
</Callout>

### Declaring the query
Named queries are defined using a `query` syntax:

#### Path Variables
```taxi
// Declares a query named getMoviesAndReviews`
query getMoviesAndReviews(
   // Define variables to be passed in
   @PathVariable("movieId") movieId: MovieId
) { ... }
----

==== Request Body

For a POST query, the request body is also available:

[,taxi]
----
query doASearch(@RequestBody searchRequest: SearchRequest) {
 ...
}
----

=== Given clause

If you've written Taxi queries before, you're used to using the https://docs.taxilang.org/language-reference/querying-with-taxiql/#providing-start-hints[given] clause
to provide data into the query.

For saved queries, that data is often passed as a variable, so the syntax is slightly different:

[,taxi]
----
// Not a saved query, given clause has a value:
given { movieId: MovieId = 123 }
find { ... }

// A saved query, the movieId comes from the params:
query findMoviesAndReviews(@PathVariable(...) movieId: MovieId) {
  given { movieId } // exposes the parameter into the query as a fact.
  find { ... }
}
----

=== Streaming results with server-sent events (SSE)

To receive query results as a continuous stream of server-sent events, set the Accept header to `text/event-stream`.

This method can be applied to both standard Request/Response queries and streaming queries.

When using SSE, especially with queries returning multiple records (e.g., database queries), the time-to-first-byte is generally faster.
This efficiency is due to records being transmitted as soon as they become available, unlike the standard approach where all records are delivered together
at the end of the request.

Example request using `curl`:

[,bash]
----
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:9022/api/q/streamingTest' \
  -H 'Accept: text/event-stream;charset-UTF-8'
----

== Saved streams

Streaming queries can be exposed over either HTTP (using server-sent events), or Websocket (or both).

Saved streams are executed in the background on the link:/docs/streams/streaming-data#the-stream-server[Stream Server].
By connecting to the output stream, you can observe the results.

Note that when you observe a result feed from a streaming query,
results are published from the point the request is received.
Previous results are not published on result stream.+++<Callout type="note" title="Heads up!">+++You can expose streaming queries on _both_ server-sent event endpoints and Websockets - simply add both the annotations.+++</Callout>+++

=== Publishing on WebSocket

To publish a query over a websocket, annotate the query with the `WebsocketOperation` annotation, declaring the `path`:+++<Callout type="note" title="Heads up!">+++For security reasons, websocket streams are only exposed under the `/api/s` path. Any queries where path in the `@WebsocketOperation` annotation starts with something other than `/api/s` are ignored+++</Callout>+++

[,taxi]
----
@WebsocketOperation(path = '/api/s/newReleases')
query getNewReleaseAnnouncements {
  stream { NewReleaseAnnouncement } as {
    title : MovieTitle
    reviewScore : ReviewScore
  }[]
}
----

=== Publishing as server-sent events

Streaming queries can also be published over HTTP by declaring a `@HttpOperation`,
and then requesting a `text/event-stream` response:

[,taxi]
----
@HttpOperation(url = '/api/q/newReleases', method = 'GET')
query getNewReleaseAnnouncements {
  stream { NewReleaseAnnouncement } as {
    title : MovieTitle
    reviewScore : ReviewScore
  }[]
}
----

Once this is published, results can be streamed by requesting a `text/event-stream`:

[,bash]
----
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:9022/api/q/newReleases' \
  -H 'Accept: text/event-stream;charset-UTF-8'
----

== Live reload

Any changes made to the queries are automatically deployed.

* When developing locally, this is as soon as you save a file
* In production, when using a Git repository, as soon as changes are merged, they're deployed on the next poll (typically a couple of minutes)

== OpenAPI

{short-product-name} automatically creates an OpenAPI spec for any query endpoints it serves.

The OpenAPI specs are available at `+/api/q/meta/{nameOfQuery}/oas+`.

For example, a query defined as `+query findMoviesAndReviews(...)+` would have an OpenAPI spec available at `/api/q/meta/findMoviesAndReviews/oas`

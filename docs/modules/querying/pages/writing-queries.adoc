= Query with {short-product-name}
:description: Submitting queries to {short-product-name}'s API to discover data

{short-product-name} focuses on querying for data based on its meaning, rather than which system provides it. This allows services to
change, and data to move, without requiring consumers to update their queries.

== Writing queries

Queries are written in https://docs.taxilang.org/language-reference/querying-with-taxiql/[TaxiQL], an open source
query language for data.

TIP: https://docs.taxilang.org/language-reference/querying-with-taxiql/[TaxiQL] is a powerful query language, and  the Taxi documentation has details on the syntax, which we haven't duplicated here.

TaxiQL is agnostic of where data comes from - it's left to {short-product-name} to discover data from the various sources that have been connected.

Here are some sample queries:

[,taxi]
----
// Find all the movies
find { Movie[] }

// Find all the movies, enriching and projecting them to a different structure
find { Movie[] } as {
   title : MovieTitle
   director : DirectorName
   rating : RottenTomatoesScore
}[]
----

== Projections

Projections are a way of taking data from one place, then transforming and combining it with other data sources.

{short-product-name} uses the information present on the object being projected in order to call services and find other information.

For example, you can project from a pre-defined type to another predefined type - such as:

```taxi
model Purchase {
   transactionId : TransactionId
   customerId : CustomerId
}

model CustomerTransaction {
  transactionId : TransactionId
  name : CustomerName
  price : Price
}

find { Purchases[] } as CustomerTransaction[] 
```

It's also very common to project from a predefined type to a type defined inline within your query
(called 'anonymous types'). For example:

[,taxi]
----
model Purchase {
   transactionId : TransactionId
   customerId : CustomerId
}

find { Purchases[] }
as {
  // Projections let you change field names, and reshape objects as required
  txn: TransactionId
  // Not present on the original Purchase object, so try to
  // find it using something we already know (in this case, the CustomerId)
  customerName: CustomerName
}
----

### Projection scopes
Creating a projection requires the syntax `something as { ... }`, which defines a projection scope:

```taxi
find { Customer } as { // start a projection scope, containing a customer
   // ... omitted ...
}
```

If you're projecting an array, then each item within the array is projected separately:

```taxi
find { Customer[] } as { // start a projection scope. 
   // Within the scope, each item is an individual Customer instance
   firstName : FirstName
}[] // Be sure to include the array marker at the end, as the object is an array.
```

If you need to, you can assign a name to the item within the scope. This can be useful 
for nested scopes, or controlling inputs into a function. For example:

```taxi
find { Customer[] } as (customer:Customer) -> {
   // referencing a field by it's name on Customer
   firstName : upperCase(customer.firstName)
   // referencing as field by it's type on Customer
   lastName : upperCase(customer::LastName)

   // using a variable within a constraint:
   purchases: Purchase[](CustomerId == customer::CustomerId)
   // without referring to a variable, Age is resolved against all variables in scope
   age : Age  
}[]
```

Or, when using nested scopes:

```taxi
find { Customer[] } as (customer:Customer) -> {
  name : CustomerName
  orders : Order[] as (order:Order) -> {
     ageAppropriate : Boolean = customer.age >= order.recommendedAge
  }
}
```

Or, to provide inputs into functions:

```taxi
model Film {
   title : FilmTitle inherits String
   headliner : ActorId
   cast: Actor[]
}

find { Film[] } as (film:Film) -> {
   title : FilmTitle
   // singleBy selects a single item from
   // an array (film.cast, an array of Actor), that matches a predicate
   // (in this case, there the actor ID is the same as the headliner id)
   star : singleBy(film.cast, (Actor) -> Actor::ActorId, film.headliner) as (actor:Actor) -> {
      name : actor.name
      title : film.title
   }
}[]
```

#### Using variables to modify what's in scope
By default, the scope contains the entire source object. For example:

```taxi
model Film {
  title : Title
  cast : Actor[]
}

find { Film } as { 
   // this scope contains an entire film record
}
```

You can modify this by specifying the type of the variable in scope:

```taxi
find { Film } as (Actor[]) -> { // note that film has been removed from the scope...
  title : Title //... therefore title isn't knowable -- this field will return null
  actorName : ActorName
}[]
```

You can also use functions to further reduce the scope:

```taxi
find { Film } as (first(Actor[])) -> {
   // Now, the scope only contains a single actor
   headliner : ActorName
} //  We're not projecting an array anymore, so no aray marker here
```

Finally, if the data defined in the scope isn't available on the source,
{short-product-name} triggers a query to find it. For example:

```taxi
// Define a few models
model Film {
   id : FilmId inherits Int
   title : Title inherits String
}

model Actor {
   name : ActorName inherits String
}

model Cast {
   actors : Actor[]
}

// And some services that return them
service Films {
   operation getFilm():Film
   operation getCast(FilmId):Cast
}

// Here's a query:
find { Film } as (Actor[]) -> {
  actorName : Name
  filmTitle : Title // should be null, as it's out-of-scope on Actor
}[]
```

In the above query:

 * `getFilm()` is called, to fetch the `Film`
 * The projection requests an `Actor[]` in the scope, which isn't available, so...
 ** A call to `getCast()` is made, passing the `FilmId` to fetch the `Actor[]`
 ** Because it's an array, each `Actor` within the array of `Actor[]` is projected individually
 ** `actorName` is read from the `name` field on `Actor`, because the requested field asks for the type `Name`
 ** `filmTitle` is out-of-scope, so returned as null

#### Declaring multiple variables in scope

In the previous example, we saw that `filmTitle` was returned as null, because
the `Film` was removed from scope.

To run the same query with `Film` in scope, simply add it to the projection:

```taxi
find { Film } as (Film, Actor[]) -> {
  actorName : Name
  filmTitle : Title // Title is now discoverable, as Film is in scope
}[]
```

=== Data discovery rules

When projecting, {short-product-name} will use information present on the source object to discover data
on the target object.

Data can be fetched from a single operation that returns the value, or by invoking a chain
of operations to return the value.

==== Operations with @Id fields on return types

If the result of an operation is an object that exposes an `@Id` field, then only operations which accept that `@Id` field as
an input will be called. For example:

[,taxi]
----
model Customer {
  @Id
  customerId: CustomerId
  name: CustomerName
}

service CustomerService {
  // Can be called when projecting, because
  // Customer has an @Id of type CustomerId
  findCustomer(CustomerId): Customer

  // Cannot be called when projecting, because
  // Customer has an @Id, and it isn't CustomerName
  findCustomerByName(CustomerName): Customer
}
----

==== Operations without @Id fields on return types

If the result of an operation is an object that _does not_ expose an `@Id` field, then it can be called with
any information available.

=== Filling in nulls

By default, if a service returns a null value, {short-product-name} will accept it 'as is'.

However, if a query annotates a field on a projection type with `@FirstNotEmpty`, {short-product-name} will
attempt to populate values by invoking operations to populate the missing values.

{short-product-name} will execute a search using the other values present on the entity being projected as potential
inputs to operations, and build a path to populate the missing values.

Operations are invoked following the standard <<data-discovery-rules,Data Discovery Rules>>.

== Understanding caching in {short-product-name}

By default, {short-product-name} does not maintain a long-lived cache between operations,
but you can xref:describing-data-sources:caching.adoc[add one] by configuring an external cache, such as Hazelcast.

Without an external cache, {short-product-name} caches operation calls for the lifetime of a query. This prevents the same operation
being invoked repeatedly while projecting multiple rows in a result.

When caching, responses are cached for a given operation and set of inputs.  If an operation is invoked with
different parameters, the cache is not used.

Operations that return an array of results and which return more than 10 values, will not have their responses cached.

// AUTHORS NOTE - Marty says that if we want this as a configurable parameter, just let him know and Orbital can expose it. In the meantime, I've commented this bit out: 
// (This is not currently configurable, but https://support.hazelcast.com/s/[contact Hazelcast Support] if you need to configure this).

== Recovering from failure

If an operation returns an error while {short-product-name} is attempting to execute a query, then it
is excluded from being invoked with the same parameters again.  This exclusion is
scoped to the query only, and expires at the end of the query.

After excluding the operation, {short-product-name} will attempt to find another path to return the
value being discovered.

== Expressions in queries

Taxi allows the definition of expressions on both https://docs.taxilang.org/language-reference/advanced-types/#expression-types[types] and https://docs.taxilang.org/language-reference/advanced-types/#expression-on-fields[fields], but doesn't
provide an evaluation engine - that's where {short-product-name} comes in.

Typically, expressions are used in a projection within a query.

You can also use them on a model to expose derived information when a model is parsed by {short-product-name} (e.g., when
returned from a service), but that's less common.  So, while this documentation focuses on query projections,
you can do everything here on a model too.

=== Writing an expression in a projection

Expressions can be defined in the fields of a projected result from a query:

[,taxi]
----
find { Flights[] }
as {
  flightNumber : FlightNumber
  totalSeatsAvailable : TotalSeats
  soldSeats : SoldSeats
  remainingSeats : Int = (this.totalSeatsAvailable - this.soldSeats)
}
----

Expressions can be defined in two ways: on a field, or on a type.

==== Expressions on a field

[,taxi]
----
// Expression types on a field:
find { Flights[] }
as {
  flightNumber : FlightNumber
  totalSeatsAvailable : TotalSeats
  soldSeats : SoldSeats
  // field expressions can be defined EITHER using field references...
  remainingSeats : Int = (this.totalSeatsAvailable - this.soldSeats)
  // ...or type references...
  remainingSeats : Int = (TotalSeats - SoldSeats)
}
----

==== Expressions on a type

To encapsulate common expressions, you can define a type with the expression:

[,taxi]
----
// Expression type:
type RemainingSeats = TotalSeats - SoldSeats

// Which is then used on a projection:
find { Flights[] }
as {
  flightNumber : FlightNumber
  totalSeatsAvailable : TotalSeats
  soldSeats : SoldSeats
  remainingSeats : RemainingSeats
}
----

Unlike field expressions, type expressions cannot use field names, and can only reference other types.

==== How {short-product-name} discovers values to evaluate expressions

When {short-product-name} is evaluating an expression, it first looks on the source object being projected
for the input values into the expression.

If any inputs are not available, then {short-product-name} will perform a search using the current data available on
the source object in an attempt to look up the value.

== Submitting queries

Generally, developers will use the UI to write and test their queries, then
integrate using {short-product-name}'s REST API.

=== REST API

Queries to {short-product-name} are submitted to the `/api/taxiql` endpoint:

----
curl 'http://localhost:9021/api/taxiql' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/taxiql' \
  --data-raw 'find { Movie[] }'
----

==== A word about content type

Strictly speaking, the content type for TaxiQL queries is `application/taxiql`. However, the {short-product-name} server will accept
TaxiQL queries with any of the following content types headers:

* `Content-Type: application/json`
* `Content-Type: application/taxiql`
* `Content-Type: text/plain`

This is to allow broad compatibility with clients.

=== Large queries with server-sent events

Running large queries can result in out-of-memory errors if {short-product-name} is holding the result set in memory.

To address this, {short-product-name} supports pushing results over server-sent events. To consume a query as a server-sent event, set
the `Accept` header to `text/event-stream`:

----
curl 'http://localhost:9021/api/taxiql' \
  -H 'Accept: text/event-stream' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/taxiql' \
  --data-raw 'find { Movie[] }'
----

Results are pushed out from {short-product-name} as they are available.

=== Including type metadata in responses

{short-product-name} can include type metadata in the responses being sent back.

To enable this, append  `?resultMode=TYPED` to the API call:

----
curl 'http://localhost:9021/api/taxiql?resultMode=TYPED' \
  -H 'Accept: text/event-stream' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/taxiql' \
  --data-raw 'find { Movie[] }'
----

== Defining output formats

By default, {short-product-name} serves results to queries as JSON.

This can be configured to customize the result format.

=== With Accept headers

The following Accept headers are supported:

|===
| Header | Result type

| `application/json`
| JSON

| `application/csv`
| CSV

| `text/event-stream`
| JSON with server-sent events
|===

== Controlling output formats

By default, data is written in JSON format.
However, this can be controlled by placing an annotation on the model
defining the output of a query.

For example:

[,taxi]
----
import flow.formats.Csv

@Csv(delimiter = "|", nullValue = "NULL")
model Person {
   firstName : FirstName inherits String
   lastName : LastName inherits String
   age : Age inherits Int
}

// Query:
// Response type (Person) contains a CSV format defined,
// which will be considered when writing responses.
find { Customer[] }
as { Person[] }
----

The following formats are supported:

* xref:data-formats:csv.adoc[CSV]
* xref:data-formats:xml.adoc[XML]
* xref:data-formats:protobuf.adoc[Protobuf]
* xref:data-formats:avro.adoc[Avro]

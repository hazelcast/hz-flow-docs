= Using OpenAPI to describe your services
:description: 'An overview of how to connect data sources to {short-product-name}'

{short-product-name} can use OpenAPI specs to understand what APIs exist, and how to call them.

{short-product-name} uses xref:describing-data-sources:intro-to-semantic-integration.adoc[Semantic schemas] to describe how data relates between systems. For OpenAPI, this
means enriching return types and input parameters with metadata to describe them semantically.

To do this, we embed Taxi metadata within the OpenAPI specs.

== Adding Taxi annotations to OpenAPI specs

Taxi annotations use a custom `x-taxi-type` block within OpenAPI specs.

Example:

[,yaml]
----
x-taxi-type:
  # The name of the type
  name: com.acme.MyType
  # Optional.  Indicates if the type should be created if not already present.
  create: false
----

The `create` element is optional, and overrides the default behavior.

If `create` is set to `false`, then schemas which attempt to publish types that aren't already defined on the schema server
are rejected as compilation errors.

This is to prevent accidental typos.

However, the default behavior for `create` is different between response models and attribute types:

|===
| Entity type | Default `create` behavior | Impact

| Model (Response type)
| `true`
| By default, if the model isn't already present within the schema, it's created

| Attribute
| `false`
| By default, if an attribute type isn't already present within the remote schema, then the OpenAPI spec is rejected
|===

=== Describing response types

Response models returned from API calls can be enriched to include semantic metadata.

==== Assigning Taxi type names to models

You can optionally define a custom type name for response types being published to {short-product-name}.
If omitted, then the type name is inferred from the rest of the schema.

[,yaml]
----
  components:
    schemas:
      Pet:
        # Assign a Taxi type name to the model.
        # Optional
       x-taxi-type:
         name: petstore.Pet
        # Everything else is standard OpenApi spec...
        allOf:
          - $ref: '#/components/schemas/NewPet'
          - required:
----

==== Adding type annotations to attributes

Enrich attributes with semantic type metadata

[,yaml]
----

      NewPet:
        required:
          - name
        properties:
          name:
           x-taxi-type:
             name: petstore.Name
            type: string
          tag:
           x-taxi-type:
             name: petstore.Tag
            type: string
----

By default, it's expected that types referred to in `x-taxi-type` within attributes have already been defined on the schema server, as part of your
xref:workspace:overview.adoc#your-core-taxonomy[core taxonomy].

However, if you are intentionally publishing new types from your OpenAPI spec, then set `create` to `true`:

[,yaml]
----
      NewPet:
        required:
          - name
        properties:
          name:
           x-taxi-type:
             name: petstore.Name
             # petstore.Name will be created if not present
             create: true
            type: string
----

=== Describing service parameters

Inputs into services can also be enriched, to annotate the semantic data required.

Simply add a `x-taxi-type` annotation to each input, containing a `name` attribute with a reference to the name of the type from your xref:workspace:overview.adoc#your-core-taxonomy[core taxonomy].

[,yaml]
----
  ## ... OpenApi spec trimmed...
  paths:
    /pets/{id}:
      get:
        description: Returns a user based on a single ID, if the user does not have access to the pet
        operationId: find pet by id
        parameters:
          - name: id
            in: path
            description: ID of pet to fetch
            required: true
            schema:
              type: integer
              format: int64
             x-taxi-type:
               name: petstore.PetId  # <-- Name of type from core taxonomy
----

== Publishing OpenAPI specs to {short-product-name}

Once you have added Taxi annotations to your OpenAPI spec, you're ready to publish it to {short-product-name}.

NOTE: Before you can import an OpenAPI spec into {short-product-name}, ensure you have configured an editable Schema source - either a local xref:workspace:connecting-a-disk-repo.adoc[disk repository] or a xref:workspace:connecting-a-git-repo.adoc[Git repository]. Be sure to enable editing of the repository when adding it. 
This lets {short-product-name} store the converted OpenAPI spec, with some additional metadata that it creates when importing.

=== Importing through the UI

* Choose *Data Sources* in the left navigation bar, then *Add data source*. 
* Select a project to import into, then choose *Swagger / OpenAPI* from the data source dropdown list.

image:select_open_api_flow.png[]

* Either provide the OpenAPI spec file directly, or enter a URL to load the spec from
* Provide a default namespace.  (eg: `com.petflix.pets`).  Services from your OpenAPI spec are imported into this namespace
* If your OpenAPI spec doesn't define a base URL (ie.,: `servers/url`), then specify one.  All paths in the OpenAPI spec are treated as relative to this path
* Click *Configure*

==== Preview your imported schema

image:open-api-preview.png[]


Your imported OpenAPI spec will be available for you to browse, to make sure everything looks correct.

Any types that have been defined as `create: true` within the Yaml spec should appear within the Types section.

Services and operations should've been created for all endpoints within your OpenAPI spec.

At this point, you can edit types (by clicking on the
pencil icon next to the type name) to further refine your schema.
Once you're happy, click *Save* and the OpenAPI spec will be imported.

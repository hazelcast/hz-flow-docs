= Using AWS services
:description: Learn how to make AWS available for {short-product-name} to query

Before you begin using AWS services, you need to define a connection to AWS in your `connections.conf` file. Read more about defining AWS connections link:/docs/describing-data-sources/configuring-connections#aws-connections[here].

{short-product-name} supports reading Protobuf messages, either as a message format for HTTP endpoints or from a streaming query originating from Kafka.

You can annotate Protobuf sources directly with Taxi metadata, or
you can import through the Schema Importer.

== DynamoDb

DynamoDb services can only be declared in Taxi.

Querying against key is supported, as are write operations.

To expose a DynamoDb service, the following two annotations are required:

* Add a ` @com.{code-product-name}.aws.dynamo.Table` to a model
* Add a `@com.{code-product-name}.aws.dynamo.DynamoService` annotation to the service

[,taxi]
----
import com.{code-product-name}.aws.dynamo.DynamoService
import com.{code-product-name}.aws.dynamo.Table

// connectionName must match the defined connection.
@Table( connectionName = "myAws" , tableName = "reviews" )
model Review {
  @Id
  movieId : MovieId
  score: ReviewScore inherits Int
}

@DynamoService
service DynamoService {
  // Exposes query operations that return Review[]
  table reviews: Review[]

  // allows upsert calls
  @UpsertOperation
  write operation saveReview(Review):Review
}
----

Write operations (such as upserts) can only be invoked in link:/docs/querying/mutations[mutations].

== Lambda

{short-product-name} can invoke a Lambda, either to discover data in a query, or in a link:/docs/querying/mutations[mutation].

A service must have the `AwsLambdaService` annotation, passing the configured connection.

Operations have the `LambdaOperation` annotation.

[,taxi]
----
import com.{code-product-name}.aws.lambda.AwsLambdaService
import com.{code-product-name}.aws.lambda.LambdaOperation

@AwsLambdaService( connectionName = "myAws" )
service MovieDb {
  @LambdaOperation(name = "streamingprovider")
  operation movieQuery(@RequestBody StreamingProviderRequest): StreamingProviderResponse
}
----

== S3

{short-product-name} can connect to S3 and read a file containing CSV data.

We're excited to expand the functionality of our S3 adapter.  If you have a use case to discuss, please https://join.slack.com/t/{short-product-name}api/shared_invite/zt-697laanr-DHGXXak5slqsY9DqwrkzHg[get in touch on Slack].

[,taxi]
----
import com.{code-product-name}.formats.Csv
@Csv
type Orders {
   symbol : Symbol by column(2)
   open : Price by column(3)
   high : Price by column(4)
   close : Price by column(6)
}
@S3Service( connectionName = "myAws" )
service AwsBucketService {
   @S3Operation(bucket = "Orders")
   vyneQl query fetchReports(body:VyneQlQuery): OrderWindowSummary[]
}
----

== SQS

=== Consuming events

{short-product-name} can subscribe to a stream of data from SQS.

[,taxi]
----
import com.{code-product-name}.aws.sqs.SqsService
import com.{code-product-name}.aws.sqs.SqsOperation

@SqsService( connectionName = "moviesConnection" )
service MovieService {
  @SqsOperation( queue = "movies" )
  operation streamMovieQuery():Stream<Movie>
}
----

This can then be queried using a standard `stream` query:

[,taxi]
----
stream { Movie }
// as ...
----

=== Publishing events

{short-product-name} can publish to a queue using a mutation:

[,taxi]
----
import com.{code-product-name}.aws.sqs.SqsService
import com.{code-product-name}.aws.sqs.SqsOperation

@SqsService( connectionName = "moviesConnection" )
service MovieService {
  @SqsOperation( queue = "movies" )
  write operation publishMoveEvent(Movie):Movie
}
----

Publishing events can only be invoked in link:/docs/querying/mutations[mutations].

==== Example: Consuming from one SQS topic, and publishing to another

[,taxi]
----
import com.{code-product-name}.aws.sqs.SqsService
import com.{code-product-name}.aws.sqs.SqsOperation

@SqsService( connectionName = "moviesConnection" )
service MovieService {

  @SqsOperation(queue = "newReleases" )
  operation newReleases():Stream<Movie>

  @SqsOperation( queue = "moviesToReview" )
  write operation publishMoveEvent(Movie):Movie
}

// Query: consume from the new releases queue, and publish to
// a "movies to review" queue
stream { Movie }
call MovieService::publishMovieEvent
----

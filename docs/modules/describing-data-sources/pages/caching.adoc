:description: Using caching with {short-product-name}


## Caching requests
By default, {short-product-name} will cache requests throughout a query only. i.e., {short-product-name} will only call a service with the same set of
parameters once within a query. 
However, caches are destroyed at the end of each query.

To enable caching, simply add `@Cache` to the top of your query:

```taxi
  @Cache
  find { Film[] } as {
    id : FilmId
    // Fetched from a remote service.
    // Calls will be cached.
    currentReviewScore : ReviewScore
  }
```


### Scoping caches
By default, all queries share the same cache.  If you want cache isolation, so that
population and invalidation are isolated from each other, you can apply a name to the cache:

```taxi
  @Cache("myCache")
  find { Film[] } as {
    id : FilmId
    // Fetched from a remote service.
    // Calls will be cached.
    currentReviewScore : ReviewScore
  }
```


## Using {short-product-name}'s local cache
{short-product-name}'s local cache runs in-process within {short-product-name}.  

It's the default cache that's enabled if no connection is provided.

It's helpful for development, but shouldn't be taken to production,
as excessive caching can cause Out-of-Memory failures and degrade performance.

```taxi
  // This query uses the default, local cache
  @Cache
  find { Film[] } as {
    id : FilmId
    // Fetched from a remote service
    currentReviewScore : ReviewScore
  }
```

### Cache TTL
{short-product-name}'s internal cache contains a TTL of 5 minutes.

This can't currently be configured, as the cache is not intended for production use.


## Using an external cache
{short-product-name} supports external caches, and will run a near-cache in-process, offloading to the remote cache
as the library supports.

To enable a remote cache, first define a connection to the cache in your `connections.conf` file, then specify
the name of the connection in your query.

```hocon connections.conf
hazelcast {
   myHazelcast {
      connectionName = myHazelcast
      addresses = ["localhost:5701"]
   }
}
```

```taxi query.taxi
  @Cache(connection = "myHazelcast")
  find { Film[] } as {
    id : FilmId
    // Fetched from a remote service
    currentReviewScore : ReviewScore
  }
```

### Supported caches
{short-product-name} supports caching with the following platforms:

 * Hazelcast
 * Redis

If you need a cache not listed, please [reach out on Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/{short-product-name}api/shared_invite/zt-697laanr-DHGXXak5slqsY9DqwrkzHg).

### Cache TTL
The default Cache TTL is defined in the connections file:

```hocon connections.conf
  hazelcast {
     myHazelcast {
        connectionName = myHazelcast
        addresses = ["localhost:5701"]
        ttl = 20 minutes
     }
  }
```

### Max-age headers
{short-product-name} will honour max-age headers when caching responses from HTTP services:

Setting the `cache-control: max-age=` header will cause the entry to be automatically evicted after the `max-age` expires.

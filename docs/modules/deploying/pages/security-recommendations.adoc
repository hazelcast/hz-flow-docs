:description Best practices for deploying into production

By default your {short-product-name} setup doesn't have authentication for easy development.

We recommend you utilise the user management from our Management Center product that comes with Hazelcast.

To utilise this see our example Docker Compose file on https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-flow-docker-compose/blob/main/docker-compose-idp.yml[Github] that configures {short-product-name} to use Management Center as its IDP.

Alternatively you can read up on the full set of configuration options on:

* xref:deploying:authentication.adoc[IDP config]
* xref:deploying:authorization.adoc[Role based Authorization]

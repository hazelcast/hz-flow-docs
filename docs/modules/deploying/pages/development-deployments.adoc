:description: How to get started with {short-product-name}

To get up and running you can quickly bring up a fully working {short-product-name} environment locally using docker compose to start testing or developing your integrations.

== Development setup

The easiest way to get started with {short-product-name} is using Hazelcasts command line too `clc`, this gives you a:

* Workspace for developing your Flows
* `docker-compose.yml` file to be able to run locally

CLC can be installed using our installation script:
[,shell]
----
curl https://hazelcast.com/clc/install.sh | bash
----

Set up your {short-product-name} workspace with:
[,shell]
----
clc project create -t hazelcast-flow-starter
----

Now you can simply start your local {short-product-name} using:
[,shell]
----
docker compose up
----

This gives you the following containers:
|===
| Name | Purpose | Interface

| {short-product-name}
| Runs the main {short-product-name} server
| http://localhost:9021

| Postgres
| Data store for your projects
| psql 25432

| Hazelcast
| An external Hazelcast cluster for storing your data
| hz 5701

| Management Center
| An interface into the workings of Hazelcast
| https://localhost:8080

|===


== Advanced Setup

* Enable xref:deploying:authentication.adoc[authentication] and xref:deploying:authorization.adoc[authorization] in {short-product-name}
* Use a xref:workspace:overview.adoc#reading-workspace-conf-from-git[Git-backed workspace.conf file], to align with IAC
* Understand how xref:deploying:managing-secrets.adoc[secrets are handled] in {short-product-name}
* Understand how to configure {short-product-name} via xref:deploying:configuring.adoc#docker[application properties] or xref:deploying:configuring.adoc#setting-as-environment-variables[environment variables]

== Deploying without CLC

A sample `docker-compose.yml` file is maintained at:

https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-flow-docker-compose

With examples for:

* Running with an external hazelcast cluster
* Using external IDP config
* Configuring to include metrics

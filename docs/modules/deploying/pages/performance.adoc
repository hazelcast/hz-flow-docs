asdf

== Minimum specs

We recommend running {short-product-name} on a machine with at least 2 cpus and 8GiB of Memory.

For production resilience please ensure you're running multiple Flow instances to ensure continued uptime.

{short-product-name} is efficient at utilising spare resources so scales very effectively as you scale the available resources.

Doubling the available resources can roughly half your processing latency and increase your overall throughput.

:description: An overview of how to connect data sources to {short-product-name}.


A {short-product-name} Workspace is a collection of schemas, API specs and Taxi projects that describe
data sources (APIs, Databases, Message queues and Serverless functions) and provide a description
of the data and capabilities they provide.

These descriptions are used to generate integration on the fly, and power your data catalog.

Data sources are described using some form of API spec language (Protobuf, OpenAPI, Avro, Taxi), along with
additional metadata that defines how concepts are related semantically.

There are lots of different ways to tell {short-product-name} about your data sources. We believe that {short-product-name} should fit with
the way you work today.

== Components

Generally, there are at least the following components:

* A taxonomy project (built using Taxi) that defines the terms embedded in your API contracts.  This is most commonly stored in Git, or locally on your machine (when you're first getting started).
* A series of API specs, enriched with metadata using terms from your taxonomy project.

=== Your core taxonomy

The core taxonomy is a collection of terms that describe your data attributes.  Think of them
as simple tags that describe your data - such as `FirstName`, `LastName`, etc.

In practice, these tags are actually semantic types, defined using https://taxilang.org[Taxi].

----
type FirstName inherits String
type LastName inherits String
type CustomerId inherits Int
----

By using Taxi, you get the benefit of a full type system, rich build tooling to verify correctness, and an
open source ecosystem to build your own plugins.

A common pattern for building a core taxonomy is:

* It is created as a standalone project, independent of any specific API / Service
* It lives in a Git repository
* {short-product-name} xref:connect-a-git-repo.adoc[monitors the Git repository] and automatically deploys changes

=== Services and data sources

Services and data sources are described using existing API specs (OpenAPI / Protobuf / JSON Schema, etc), enriched
with semantic tags from <<your-core-taxonomy,your core taxonomy>>.

}
----

For more information, see the topics on using xref:describe-data-sources:open-api.adoc[OpenAPI] or xref:data-formats:protobuf.adoc[Protobuf] to describe your data sources.


==== Use Taxi

Another option is authoring your API specs directly in xref:introduction:about-taxi.adoc[Taxi]:

[,taxi]
----
model Customer {
  id : CustomerId inherits Int
  firstName : CustomerFirstName inherits String
}

service CustomerService {
  @HttpOperation(method = "GET", url = "/shoppingCart/{CustomerId}")
  operation getShoppingCartByCustomerId(CustomerId):ShoppingCart
}
----

Alternatively, you can just generate schema definitions directly from code, or author your definitions in Taxi.

Once you've chosen how to describe your services, next publish your specs to {short-product-name}.

== Publish and update your specs

How and when you choose to publish / update these sources is up to you - teams tend to have different preferences around this.

You're also free to mix and match. Just pick the publication method that best works for your tech and your team's working style.

The following publication methods are available:

* Pushing API specs to {short-product-name} (e.g., when your microservices start)
* Pushing updates to {short-product-name} manually (e.g., within a CI/CD pipeline)
* Having {short-product-name} poll sources for changes

=== Push API specs directly from your apps

Applications can generate Taxi, direct from code, and publish to {short-product-name}.

This suits microservices and teams who prefer generating their API specs from code.

// * Currently only Java / Kotlin with Spring Boot is supported, but other SDKs are planned.

// Learn more about this approach link:./schema-publication-methods[here].

// TODO: Flesh this out

////
### Pushing updates to {short-product-name} manually (CI/CD)
Data sources can publish updated specs to {short-product-name} manually, using our CLI, or direct to our API.  This is a good fit
for teams that choose to push updates as part of a CI/CD cycle.

 * Suits teams who publish API specs during a CI/CD job

Learn more about this approach [here](./publishing-direct-to-{short-product-name})
////

=== Pull API specs from {short-product-name}

{short-product-name} can be configured to fetch API specs (projects) from either Git repositories
or the file system where {short-product-name} is running (intended for local development).

In addition to storing your <<your-core-taxonomy,core taxonomy>> in Git, you can fetch other API specs (such as Protobuf or OpenApi) from
a Git repository.

{short-product-name} will poll your Git repo, and automatically update as changes are merged into your target branch.

For more information, read about xref:connect-a-git-repo.adoc[pulling API specs from Git] or xref:connect-a-disk-repo.adoc[reading API specs from local disk].

== Workspace.conf file

The `workspace.conf` file is a HOCON file that describes all the locations to pull code from.  (Data sources that
are <<push-api-specs-directly-from-your-apps,pushing their API specs>> are not included.)

Schemas can be pulled from multiple different formats and approaches.  The configuration for these
repositories is defined in a https://github.com/lightbend/config#examples-of-hocon[HOCON] format file.

=== Pass a workspace.conf file

//rebranded vyne to flow in --flow.workspace.config-file below - check

By default, the configuration file is called `workspace.conf`. However, the location of the file can be changed by setting `--flow.workspace.config-file=/path/to/workspace.conf`
on the command line, or through any of the supported configuration overriding mechanisms.

[#read-workspace-conf-from-git]
=== Read workspace.conf from Git

For production deployments, it's often preferable to read config directly from Git. This is useful both for Infrastructure-as-code, as well as for
deploying to services where there's ephemeral storage (like AWS ECS).

You can configure {short-product-name} to read a `workspace.conf` file from a git repository, by passing the following command line settings:

|===
| Setting | Description

| `flow.workspace.git.url`
| The url of the Git repo to clone. If pulling from Github, Gitlab or Azure DevOps, use a personal access token in the url (eg: `+https://username:personalAccessToken@github.com/username/yourRepoName.git+` or `https://[username]:[personalAccessToken]@dev.azure.com/[yourOrgName]/[yourProjectName]/_git/[yourRepoName]`)

| `flow.workspace.git.branch`
| The name of the branch to check out

| `flow.workspace.git.path`
| _Optional_ The path within the repo to read the config file. Defaults to `workspace.conf`
|===

=== Use a single-project workspace

For demos / test config, it's sometimes useful to start {short-product-name} with a single project configured.

You can bypass the workspace config, and point {short-product-name} directly to a single local file-system project.

To do this, start {short-product-name} with `--flow.workspace.project-file=/path/to/taxi.conf`

=== Configure conventions

Durations are defined using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations[ISO 8601] formats.  For example:

* 1 Day = `P1D`
* 3 Seconds = `PT3S`

         name=my-git-project
         uri="https://github.com/something.git"
      }
   ]
}
----

== Include a README.md file

If you supply a README.md file at the root of the project, it will be read by {short-product-name} and displayed in the UI.

https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax[Github flavored markdown]
is supported, along with some special code snippets.

=== Taxi snippets
Standard Taxi can be included by using the following syntax:

[source,markdown]
----
```taxi
@DatabaseService(connection = "my-postgres-db")
service MyPostgresService {

   // table declares read operations, such as querying
   table ticketSales : VenueTicketSalesRecord[]

   // An upsert operation, for performing upsert queries
   @UpsertOperation
   write operation saveTicketSalesRecord(VenueTicketSalesRecord):VenueTicketSalesRecord
}
```
----


=== TaxiQL snippets
Taxi queries that can be run in the query editor in {short-product-name} can be included like this:

[source,markdown]
----
```taxiql
find { VenueTicketSales[] }
call MyPostgresService::saveTicketSalesRecord
```
----

image:taxiql-snippet.png[]


### Schema diagram snippets
Schema diagrams can be included with the following syntax:

[source,markdown]
----
```schemaDiagram
{
   "members" : {
      "TicketsS3Bucket" : {},
      "VenueTicketSales" : {},
      "TicketPricesApi" : {}
   }
}
```
----

This will produce the following interactive component within the README in {short-product-name}:

= Pulling API specs from Git
:description: {short-product-name} can read schema and taxonomy definitions direct from Git.

It's common to store your xref:workspace:overview.adoc#your-core-taxonomy[core taxonomy], existing API specs (such as xref:describing-data-sources:open-api.adoc[OpenApi] or xref:describing-data-sources:protobuf.adoc[Protobuf]), or xref:describing-data-sources:databases.adoc[database definitions]
in a Git repository, so they're version controlled.

{short-product-name} can read directly from your Git repository, pulling in updates as they're merged.

A typical Git configuration consists of:

* The address of your Git repository
* A branch to monitor
* A path within your repository to read

Additionally, if you're connecting an OpenAPI or Protobuf source, you'll need to provide a little additional metadata.

The list of Git repositories for {short-product-name} can be modified either through the <<adding-a-git-repository-using-the-ui,{short-product-name} UI>>,
or by editing a <<adding-a-git-repository-through-config,config file>>, which can be version controlled, and automatically deployed (self-hosted deployments only).

== Adding a Git repository using the UI

To add a new Git repository via the UI, click on *Projects* on the left navigation bar, then *Add project* in the top bar.

=== Completing the new Git repository form

Click on the *Git Repository* tab, and provide the details of how to connect to your Git repo.

TIP: After adding the URL of your repository, click *Test Connection*. {short-product-name} will verify the connection works,
  and fetch the list of branches (including the default branch) from your repository.

== Adding a Git repository through config

The schema repositories that {short-product-name} is connected to can be configured through a xref:deploying:configuring.adoc[HOCON file], which by default is called `workspace.conf`.

         # The path within the git repo (Optional, by default uses the root)
         path="/a/path/to/a/folder"
      }
   ]
}

The full documentation for config-driven Git repositories is available xref:deploying:configuring.adoc#configuring-git-repositories[here].

=== Reading OpenAPI specs from Git

If {short-product-name} is reading an OpenAPI spec from Git, a few more parameters are needed.

----
git {
   # The root directory where all git repositories are cloned to
   checkoutRoot="/opt/service/flow/git-root"
   # How frequently Flow should poll git repositories for changes
   pollFrequency=PT30S

   # A collection of Git Repository configurations
   repositories=[
      {
         # Give this repo a name.
         name=hamilton-taxonomy

         # The url (including personal access token) to clone the repo from
         uri="https://alexhamilton:glpat-dundadadadundundun@github.com/flow/reynolds-pamphlet"

         # The branch to monitor
         branch=master

         # The path within the git repo (Optional, by default uses the root)
         path="/a/path/to/a/folder"

         loader: {
            # Must be OpenApi
            packageType: 'OpenApi'

            # Flow will automatically create services and models
            # from the OpenApi spec, and place them under this namespace.
            # Mandatory.
            defaultNamespace: 'com.hamilton'

            # If the paths specified in the OpenApi spec are relative,
            # and no base path is specified, then specify one here.
            serviceBasePath: https://hamilton.com/

            # Provides a project identifier for this API spec.
            # Mandatory
            identifier: {
              organisation: acme
              name: hamilton
              # Must be a Semver version
              version: '1.1.0'
            }
         }
      }
   ]
}

== Git URLs and authentication

Currently, only `https://` connections are supported.

To provide authentication credentials, use a Username + Personal Authentication Token (supported in GitHub and GitLab).

For example:

----
https://alexhamilton:glpat-dundadadadundundun@github.com/flow/reynolds-pamphlet
----

Support for `ssh://` connections with public/private keypairs is available in a private beta.  If you'd like to try it out, please https://support.hazelcast.com/s/[get in touch].

== Supporting edits to Git repositories

When changes are made to services or taxonomy definitions within {short-product-name}'s UI, these need to be written
somewhere.

It's common that these are persisted to a Git repository.

{short-product-name} supports two different flows for edits:

* Committing and pushing directly to the configured branch (default)
* Committing and pushing to a branch, and raising a Pull Request (GitHub only)

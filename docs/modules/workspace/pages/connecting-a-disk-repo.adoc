= Pulling API specs from disk
:description: {short-product-name} can read schema and taxonomy definitions direct from local disk.

NOTE: Using a local disk repo is a great way to get started. However, for production, consider using a Git repo instead.

// Link to this topic from 'Git repo' (broken in Orbital): /docs/connecting-data-sources/connecting-a-git-repo 

When you're getting started, it's useful to store your xref:workspace:overview.adoc#your-core-taxonomy[core taxonomy], existing API specs (such as xref:describing-data-sources:open-api.adoc[OpenAPI] or xref:describing-data-sources:protobuf.adoc[Protobuf]), or xref:describing-data-sources:databases.adoc[database definitions]
in a local disk repo, making it quick and easy to get going.

== Adding a file repository using the UI

To add a new file repository via the UI, either navigate to http://localhost:9022/projects/project-import[/project-import] or, from within the UI,
click on *Projects* on the left navigation bar, then *Add project* in the top bar.
Authors Note - project import link does not work - what should this be to?

=== Completing the new file repository form

Click on the Local Disk table, and provide the details of where your local repository is.

If you haven't created one yet, just provide an empty directory, and a repository will be created for you.

== Adding a file repository through config

The schema repositories that {short-product-name} is connected to can be configured through a xref:deploying:configuring.adoc[HOCON file], which by default is called `workspace.conf`.

NOTE: File paths that are absolute are resolved against the file system. File paths that are relative are resolved relative to the location of the config file.

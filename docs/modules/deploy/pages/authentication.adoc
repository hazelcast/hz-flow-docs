:description: Configure {short-product-name} to require authentication through Management Center

{short-product-name} does not provide a user interface for managing users or roles. Instead, it relies on the https://docs.hazelcast.com/management-center/5.5[Management Center] (MC) for identity management, utilizing https://docs.hazelcast.com/management-center/5.5/deploy-manage/security-providers[MC security providers] as identity providers. When a user attempts to access {short-product-name}, they will be redirected to the identity provider's login page as configured with the MC.

Single Sign-On (SSO) and Single Logout (SLO) are pre-configured between {short-product-name} and MC, ensuring a seamless login and logout experience. This means that when a user logs in or out of one product, they are automatically logged in or out of the other.

== Identity provider configuration through Management Center
Users *must* configure their identity providers through MC. This can be done using either the MC user interface or the https://docs.hazelcast.com/management-center/5.5/deploy-manage/mc-conf[Management Center Configuration Tool].

There are 2 ways to use MC as an identity provider:

. MC can act as the identity provider itself for the following security providers:
  * https://docs.hazelcast.com/management-center/5.5/deploy-manage/local-security-provider[Local Security Provider]
. MC can be configured to use an external identity provider for the following security providers:
  * https://docs.hazelcast.com/management-center/5.5/deploy-manage/active-directory[Active Directory]
  * https://docs.hazelcast.com/management-center/5.5/deploy-manage/jaas[JAAS]
  * https://docs.hazelcast.com/management-center/5.5/deploy-manage/ldap[LDAP]
  * https://docs.hazelcast.com/management-center/5.5/deploy-manage/saml[SAML]
  * https://docs.hazelcast.com/management-center/5.5/deploy-manage/openid[Open ID connect]

== Steps to run {short-product-name} with Management Center as the identity provider:

. Run one of the Docker Compose files given below to spin up {short-product-name} and MC. The security provider can be configured in 2 ways:
  a. Through the https://docs.hazelcast.com/management-center/5.5/deploy-manage/mc-conf[Management Center Configuration Tool]. An example can be found below.
  b. Through the user interface of MC. To do this, open the landing page of {short-product-name} or MC. An example can be found below.
. After the security provider is configured through MC, go to the landing page of {short-product-name} or MC.
  * {short-product-name} is configured to run on http://localhost:9021 unless overridden.
  * MC is configured to run on http://localhost:8080 unless overridden.
. Enter your credentials and login. Thanks to SSO, you are logged into both applications.

Internal notes to Hazelcast employees:

Flow is distributed to customers with MC pre-configured as the single source of authentication. For Flow-MC Single-Sign-On integration, Open ID connect authentication service is used via authorization code flow with PKCE pattern. Flow’s security configuration will not be disclosed to customers to prevent potential misuse.

Here is an example Docker Compose file for security pre-configuration of Flow with MC:

environment:
    FLOW_SECURITY_OPENIDP_SCOPE: "openid email profile"
    OPTIONS: >-
#       To enable OpenID Connect authentication. Defaults to false.
        --flow.security.openIdp.enabled=true

#       The openIdp issuer endpoint. The browser will redirect to this endpoint, so ensure the DNS entry is accessible via browser traffic. localhost is possibly OK here.
        --flow.security.openIdp.issuerUrl=http://localhost:8080

#       The client ID to present to OpenID server.
        --flow.security.openIdp.clientId=flow-client

#       A URL to load the set of JWKs used to verify signatures of presented tokens. This URL is called by Flow's server, so ensure that the DNS entry is accessible to Flow. localhost is unlikely to work here.
        --flow.security.openIdp.jwks-uri=http://host.docker.internal:8080/oauth2/jwks
Note: host.docker.internal only works on linux based machines. If MC is configured to run in a Docker Compose file with management-center service name, this property can be set to http://management-center:8080/oauth2/jwks.

#       Indicates if auth must be performed over https. Defaults to true.
        --flow.security.openIdp.require-https=false

#       To configure Flow to read the roles from the JWT, set the path to provide a custom path.
        --flow.security.open-idp.roles.format=path

#       To configure Flow to read the roles from the JWT, set the path within the JWT for the roles.
        --flow.security.open-idp.roles.path=roles

#       When refresh tokens are disabled, Flow performs a silent refresh for OIDC implicit flow via hidden iframe. Defaults to false.
        --flow.security.open-idp.refreshTokensDisabled=true

#       Optional. A URL where authenticated users may be redirected, to manage their account
#       --flow.security.openIdp.account-management-url=http:..localhost:8080/settings

#       Optional. A URL where authenticated users may be redirected, to manage their organization. Generally, this is where roles are assigned to users
#       --flow.security.openIdp.org-management-url=http:..localhost:8080/settings

------------------------------------

The presented JWT is expected to have the following attributes:
 * sub: Required, subject - identifier for the end-user at the issuer
 * iss: Required, issuer - the OIDC provider who authenticated the user
 * One of preferred_username or first_name and last_name: Required, shorthand name by which the end-user wishes to be referred to at the RP, such as janedoe or j.doe
 * One of email or clientId: Required, something that uniquely identifies the user
 * One of picture or picture_url: Optional, the user's avatar
 * name: Optional, end-user's full name in displayable form including all name parts, possibly including titles and suffixes, ordered according to the end-user's locale and preferences

Below you can find example Docker Compose files where MC is the identity provider and a more complex scenario where MC is configured to use an external identity provider.

NOTE: MC is preconfigured as the identity provider for {short-product-name} with the configuration prefixed `flow.security` and `FLOW_SECURITY` in the Docker Compose files below. Please update specified properties only when necessary; changing others may lead to unexpected results.

[#modification-of-sec-preconfig]
=== Potential modification of security pre-configuration
The following properties can be changed or not; please consider your use case carefully.

. **--flow.security.openIdp.issuerUrl**: The openIdp issuer endpoint. This should be set to the MC's address. The browser will redirect to this endpoint, so ensure the DNS entry is accessible via browser traffic. `localhost` is possibly OK here. Example: Unless overridden, MC runs on http://localhost:8080. This property can be set to http://localhost:8080.

. **--flow.security.openIdp.jwks-uri**: A URL to load the set of JWKs used to verify signatures of presented tokens. This URL is called by  {short-product-name}'s server, so ensure that the DNS entry is accessible to  {short-product-name}. `localhost` is unlikely to work here. Example: Assume that MC is configured to run in a Docker Compose file with management-center service name. This property can be set to http://management-center:8080/oauth2/jwks.

. **--flow.security.openIdp.require-https**: Indicates if auth must be performed over https. Set this to true if MC and {short-product-name} runs on https servers.

=== Example: Local security pre-configuration with via hz-mc tool
Run https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-flow-docker-compose/blob/main/docker-compose-idp-local-sec-preconfigured.yml[this Docker Compose file] with usernames `admin`, `user`, `user`, `readonly` or `metricsonly` and password `changeMe!135`.

Notice usage of `./bin/mc-conf.sh` in the Docker Compose file.

Once the containers have started, go to the landing page of MC or {short-product-name}, and you will see the following login screen:

image:mc-local-security-provider-login.png[]

=== Example: External identity provider configuration through user interface
Run https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-flow-docker-compose/blob/main/docker-compose-idp.yml[this Docker Compose file].

Once the containers have started, configure your external identity provider with https://docs.hazelcast.com/management-center/5.5/deploy-manage/openid[OIDC] or https://docs.hazelcast.com/management-center/5.5/deploy-manage/saml[SAML], go to the landing page of MC or {short-product-name}, and you will see the following login screen:

image:external-idp-oidc-login.png[]

== Obtain an Access Token
If your application needs machine-to-machine communication with {short-product-name}, MC utilizes client credentials flow under the hood. Here are the steps:

. Set the MC_APPLICATION_CLIENT_SECRET environment variable, MC will create a client with a client credential grant type named `application-client`. For simplicity, let's assume the environment variable is set to `qqq` for a quick example.
. Run https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-flow-docker-compose/blob/main/docker-compose-idp.yml[this Docker Compose file].
. Get an access token from MC and use it as bearer token in subsequent requests to {short-product-name}. Example curl request for Viewer role:
[,curl]
----
curl --location '\{MC-host\}/oauth2/token' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic YXBwbGljYXRpb24tY2xpZW50OnFxcQ==' \
--data-urlencode 'grant_type=client_credentials' \
--data-urlencode 'scope=openid email profile flow:Viewer'
----

Notices:

* `MC_APPLICATION_CLIENT_SECRET` can be omitted from the environment variables to disable client credential grants
* `MC_APPLICATION_CLIENT_SECRET` should be treated as a secret and set to a secure string. Consider using the following or similar to generate a secure secret +
 `openssl rand -base64 32`
* The `\{MC-host\}` in the example should be set to the Management Center hostname. The default config listens on http://localhost:8080 unless overridden
* The example Authorization header: `YXBwbGljYXRpb24tY2xpZW50OnFxcQ==` is the base64 encoded version of `application-client:qqq`
* If `flow` is not set in scope, the admin role will be assigned
* Multiple roles are also supported, example curl request for Viewer and MetricsViewer:
[,curl]
----
curl --location '{MC-host}/oauth2/token' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic YXBwbGljYXRpb24tY2xpZW50OnFxcQ==' \
--data-urlencode 'grant_type=client_credentials' \
--data-urlencode 'scope=openid email profile flow:Viewer flow:MetricsViewer'
----

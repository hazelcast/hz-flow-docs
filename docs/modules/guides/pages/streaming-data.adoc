:description: A tutorial showing how to build event streams

This tutorial shows how to build bespoke, enriched event streams from Kafka.

== Describing the data sources

image:Architecture.png[Architecture for this demo]

Our demo has a few services running, which we'll join together to create a bespoke event stream:

* *Kafka Service*: A topic that publishes a message whenever a new review is published
* *FilmsDb*: A database containing a list of films
* *ListingsApi*: A REST API that tells us where our movies are currently playing

Our services share a taxonomy used to describe the elements we can fetch:

```taxi taxonomy.taxi
namespace reviews {
    type FilmId inherits String
    type FilmTitle inherits String
    type ReviewText inherits String
    type PerformanceDate inherits DateTime
    type TheatreName inherits String
}
```

### Adding the Kafka broker

Configure the Kafka connection in `connections.conf`:

```hocon connections.conf
kafka {
    "my-kafka" {
        connectionName=my-kafka
        connectionParameters {
            brokerAddress="kafka:19092"
            groupId=flow
        }
    }
}
```

=== Describing the Kafka topic

Next, add some Taxi metadata to the message written onto our Kafka topic:

[,protobuf]
----
@lang.taxi.formats.ProtobufMessage(packageName = "" , messageName = "NewReviewPostedMessage")
model NewReviewPostedMessage {
   @lang.taxi.formats.ProtobufField(tag = 1 , protoType = "int32") filmId : reviews.FilmId
   @lang.taxi.formats.ProtobufField(tag = 2 , protoType = "string") reviewText : reviews.ReviewText
}
----

Finally, declare the Kafka topic:

```taxi reviews.taxi
@flow.kafka.KafkaService(connectionName = "my-kafka")
service KafkaService {

  @flow.kafka.KafkaOperation(topic = "reviews" , offset = "latest")
  stream reviews : Stream<NewReviewPostedMessage>
}
```

## Creating an event stream

We can create a dedicated event stream with the data we need by submitting the following query to {short-product-name}:

NOTE: The following query is an example of how your streaming query might look if a Kafka topic named `reviews`, a database named `FilmsDb`, and a REST API named `ListingsApi` are connected.

```taxi
stream { NewReviewPostedMessage } as {
  // We define the field names that matter to us.
  // Flow matches on data types, as field names often differ between systems.
  id : FilmId
  review : ReviewText

  name : FilmTitle // Fetched by a database call
  nextPerformances: FilmListing[] // Fetched by a REST API call
}
```

= Working with XML and JSON
:description: A tutorial showing how to link services that publish XML

This tutorial features services publishing a mix of XML and JSON, and explains how to combine them and expose the
composed services as a REST API.

It shows starting an {lpn} project from scratch so, if you're unfamiliar with {short-product-name}, this is the perfect starting point.

// This demo has a video walkthrough that discusses how it's built:

== Overview

This guide shows how to connect:

[,taxi]
----
// A service the returns a list of Films (in XML)
operation findAllFilms():FilmList

// A service that returns the cast of a film (in XML)
operation findCast(FilmId):ActorList

// A service that returns the list of awards a film has won (in JSON)
operation findAwards(FilmId):Award[]
----

image:2architecture-overview.png[The services in our demo]

We'll stitch these together, and expose a REST API that returns the data from all three services.

== Setting up

// https://www.loom.com/share/d7819e1108e7401094dbdad39796bbf4?sid=74e2d602-ca34-4e62-977b-d7eb482dde47&t=92[Jump to this section of the video]

To get started, install Taxi using https://sdkman.io/[SDKMan] and create a new project:

[,bash]
----
sdk install taxi
taxi init
# follow prompts to create your taxi project
----

Then launch an {short-product-name} developer environment:

----
taxi flow
----

This downloads a Docker Compose file which configures a local developer environment of {short-product-name} that live-reloads your
Taxi project changes.

== Describing the Film Service

// https://www.loom.com/share/d7819e1108e7401094dbdad39796bbf4?sid=74e2d602-ca34-4e62-977b-d7eb482dde47&t=247[Jump to this section of the video]

Write some Taxi that describes our Film service:

[tabs]
====
films.taxi::
+
[source,taxi]
----
import flow.formats.Xml 
// The @Xml annotation tells Flow how to read this object 
@Xml model FilmList { 
  item : Film[]
   } 
   model Film { 
    id : FilmId inherits Int 
    title : FilmTitle inherits String 
    yearReleased : YearReleased inherits Int
     } 
     service FilmsService { 
      @HttpOperation(url = "http://localhost:8044/films", method = "GET") 
      operation getAllFilms():FilmList
       }
----
films-data.xml::
+
[source,xml]
----
<List>
    <item id="0">
      <title>ACADEMY DINOSAUR</title>
      <yearReleased>2005</yearReleased>
    </item>
    <item id="1">
      <title>ACE GOLDFINGER</title>
      <yearReleased>1975</yearReleased>
    </item>
  </List>
----
====

== Integrating the Cast Service

Our CastService takes the ID of a Film, and returns a list of actors:

[tabs]
====
actors.taxi::
+
[source,taxi]
----
import flow.formats.Xml 
@Xml model ActorList { 
  item : Actor[] 
} 
  model Actor { 
    id : ActorId inherits Int 
    name : ActorName inherits String
} 
     service CastService { 
      @HttpOperation(url = "http://localhost:8044/film/\{filmId}/cast", method = "GET") 
      operation fetchCastForFilm(@PathVariable("filmId") filmId : FilmId):ActorList
}
----
actor-data.xml::
+
[source,xml]
----
<List>
  <item>
    <id>34</id>
    <name>JUDY DEAN</name>
  </item>
  <item>
    <id>21</id>
    <name>ELVIS MARX</name>
  </item>
</List>
----
====

=== What connects it together

{short-product-name} now has enough information to link our services together:

[,taxi]
----
// The FilmId from our Film model...
model Film {
  id : FilmId inherits Int
  ...
}
// ... is used as an input to our fetchCastForFilm operation:
operation fetchCastForFilm(FilmId):ActorList
----

We don't need to write any integration code or resolvers.  There's enough information in the schemas.

NOTE: We've written a bit more Taxi here, as we chose not to work with the service's XSD directly (e.g., it wasn't available, or it didn't exist). If these services published XSDs or WSDLs, we could've leveraged them, and only needed to declare the Taxi scalars, such as `FilmId`.

== Writing Data Queries

// https://www.loom.com/share/d7819e1108e7401094dbdad39796bbf4?sid=74e2d602-ca34-4e62-977b-d7eb482dde47&t=673[Jump to this section of the video]

{short-product-name} uses type metadata to understand how to link things together.  Rather than writing integration code,
we write a query for data using TaxiQL.

=== Fetch the list of films

[,taxi]
----
// Just fetch the ActorList
find { FilmList }
----

Which returns:

[,json]
----
{
   "item": [
      {
         "id": 0,
         "title": "ACADEMY DINOSAUR",
         "yearReleased": 2005
      },
      {
         "id": 1,
         "title": "ACE GOLDFINGER",
         "yearReleased": 1975
      },
      // snip
   ]
}
----

=== Restructure the result

We'd like to remove the `item` wrapper (which is carried over from the XML format), so we change the query, to ask just for a `Film[]`

[,taxi]
----
find { FilmList } as Film[]
----

Which returns:

[,json]
----
[
  {
   "id": 0,
   "title": "ACADEMY DINOSAUR",
   "yearReleased": 2005
  },
  {
   "id": 1,
   "title": "ACE GOLDFINGER",
   "yearReleased": 1975
  }
]
----

=== Defining a custom response object

We can define a data contract of the exact data we want back, specifying the field names we like,
with the data type indicating where the data is sourced from:

[,taxi]
----
find { FilmList } as (Film[]) -> {
    filmId : FilmId
    nameOfFilm : FilmTitle
}
----

=== Linking our Actor Service

To include data from our `CastService`, we just ask for the actor information:

[,taxi]
----
  find { FilmList } as (Film[]) -> {
      filmId : FilmId
      nameOfFilm : FilmTitle
>     cast : Actor[]
  }
----

Which now gives us:

[,json]
----
{
   "filmId": 0,
   "nameOfFilm": "ACADEMY DINOSAUR",
   "cast": [
      {
         "id": 18,
         "name": "BOB FAWCETT"
      },
      {
         "id": 28,
         "name": "ALEC WAYNE"
      },
    //..snip
   ]
}
----

== Adding our Awards Service

We can also define a schema and service for our awards information, which is returned in JSON:

[tabs]
====
awards.taxi::
+
[source,taxi]
----
model Award { 
  title : AwardTitle inherits String 
  yearWon : YearWon inherits Int
} 
   service AwardsService { 
    @HttpOperation(url = "http://localhost:8044/film/\{filmId}/awards", method = "GET") 
    operation fetchAwardsForFilm(@PathVariable("filmId") filmId : FilmId):Award[]
}
----
awards-data.json::
+
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "title": "Best Makeup and Hairstyling", 
    "yearWon": 2020
  }, 
  { 
    "title": "Best Original Score", 
    "yearWon": 2020 
  }, 
  // snip\... 
]
----
====

=== Enriching our query

Finally, to include this awards data, we just add it to our query:

[,taxi]
----
  find { FilmList } as (Film[]) -> {
      filmId : FilmId
      nameOfFilm : FilmTitle
      cast : Actor[]
      awards : Award[]
  }
----

Which gives us:

[,json]
----
{
   "filmId": 0,
   "nameOfFilm": "ACADEMY DINOSAUR",
   "cast" : [] // omitted
   "awards": [
      {
         "title": "Best Documentary Feature",
         "yearWon": 2020
      },
      {
         "title": "Best Supporting Actress",
         "yearWon": 2020
      },
   ]
}
----

== Publishing our query as a REST API

Now that we're happy with our response data, we can publish this query as a REST API.

* First, we wrap the query in a `+query { ... }+` block, and save it in our Taxi project
* Then we add an `+@HttpOperation(...)+` annotation

[tabs]
====
query.taxi::
+
[source,taxi]
----
@HttpOperation(url = '/api/q/filmsAndAwards', method = 'GET')
 query filmsAndAwards {
      find { FilmList } as (Film[]) \-> {
          filmId : FilmId
          nameOfFilm : FilmTitle
          awards : Award[]
          cast : Actor[]
      }
 }
----
====

Our query is now available at http://localhost:9021/api/q/filmsAndAwards

[,bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:9021/api/q/filmsAndAwards | jq
----

Which gives us:

[,json]
----
[
  {
    "filmId": 0,
    "nameOfFilm": "ACADEMY DINOSAUR",
    "awards": [
      {
        "title": "Best Animated Feature",
        "yearWon": 2020
      },
      {
        "title": "Best Original Score for a Comedy",
        "yearWon": 2020
      },
      {
        "title": "Best Documentary Feature",
        "yearWon": 2020
      },
      // .... snip
    ]
  }
]
----

== Wrapping up and next steps

In this guide, we've:

* Created a Taxi project
* Exposed XML services and modelled their responses
* Written a query stitching three services together
* Published that query as an HTTP service

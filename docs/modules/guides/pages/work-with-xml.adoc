= Work with XML and JSON
:description: A tutorial showing how to link services that publish XML

This tutorial shows how to link services that publish a mixture of XML and JSON. It explains how to combine these services and then expose them as a REST API.

How to begin a {lpn} project is described from scratch so, if you're unfamiliar with {short-product-name}, this is the perfect starting point.

Typically, you'll use {short-product-name} to stitch together services in different locations from across your organization but, to keep it simple, these are deployed below as a single service. 

== Overview

This tutorial shows how to connect the following three services:

[,taxi]
----
// A service that returns a list of Films (in XML)
operation findAllFilms():FilmList

// A service that returns the cast of a film (in XML)
operation findCast(FilmId):ActorList

// A service that returns the list of awards a film has won (in JSON)
operation findAwards(FilmId):Award[]
----

You'll combine these together to create a single endpoint that exposes a REST API to return the data from all three services.

=== Prerequisites

You should have https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/[Docker] and https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[Docker Compose].

== Step 1 - Start a local instance of {short-product-name}

In this tutorial, we're going to deploy {short-product-name}, as well as a demo projects
that we'll use throughout this tutorial.

Everything you need is packaged up in a Docker Compose file to make getting started easier.

To launch, clone the repository and follow instructions in the https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-flow-public-demos/blob/main/xml-and-json/README.md[README] file:

[,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-flow-public-demos.git
cd hazelcast-flow-public-demos/xml-and-json
----

After about a minute, {short-product-name} should be available at http://localhost:9021.

To make sure everything is ready to go, head to the http://localhost:9021/projects[Projects Explorer] to make sure that some schemas are registered.
It should look like the screenshot below.  If you see a message saying there's nothing registered, wait a few moments longer.

image:projects-screen-xml.png[The Projects screen]

You now have {short-product-name} running locally, along with an example REST service which we'll use in our next steps.

If you run `docker ps`, you should see a collection of Docker containers now running.

|===
| Container Name | Part of {short-product-name} stack or Demo? | Description

| {code-product-name}
| {short-product-name}
| The core {short-product-name} server, which provides our UI, and runs all our integration for us

| postgres
| {short-product-name}
| A Postgres DB, used by flow to store its metadata

| management-center
| {short-product-name}
| The Management Center, for monitoring and managing {short-product-name}

| xml-and-json-films-xml
| Demo
| A REST API, which exposes information about films in XML and JSON format

|===

With {short-product-name}, instead of using integration code, schemas are used to describe  data sources which {short-product-name} uses to link everything together. Some services publish their own schemas (e.g. XSDs or WSDLs) but the following example shows how to do this without schemas, with everything written in Taxi. 


== Step 2 - Describe the Film Service

First, write Taxi code that describes the Films Service. This is an HTTP operation that returns a list of films.

In the Taxi model, you'll notice that the name of the field is composed of special types that will be used to share data across services and connect them together. 
This means you are not coupled to field names, which are free to change without impacting the model. 

The Taxi code that describes the FilmsService is shown in the *films.taxi* tab below, and an example of the list of films returned is shown in the *films-data.xml* tab.

To add the taxi definitions to your project, copy the code into a file called called `films.taxi` in the directory `taxi/src` in your project.

[tabs]
====
films.taxi::
+
[source,taxi]
----
import flow.formats.Xml

// The @Xml annotation tells Flow how to read this object
@Xml
model FilmList {
  item: Film[]
}

model Film {
  id: FilmId inherits Int
  title: FilmTitle inherits String
  yearReleased: YearReleased inherits Int
}

service FilmsService {
  @HttpOperation(url = "http://films-xml:80/films", method = "GET")
  operation getAllFilms(): FilmList
}

----
films-data.xml::
+
[source,xml]
----
<List>
  <item id="0">
    <title>ACADEMY DINOSAUR</title>
    <yearReleased>2005</yearReleased>
  </item>
  <item id="1">
    <title>ACE GOLDFINGER</title>
    <yearReleased>1975</yearReleased>
  </item>
</List>
----
====

TIP: Once you have exposed this service, you will be able to see it in the *Services diagram* in {short-product-name}'s *Catalog* to view how everything links together.



== Step 3 - Integrate the Cast Service

Repeat this process to define a Taxi schema for the film cast. 

The CastService takes the FilmId you created previously and uses this to return a list of actors.

The Taxi code that describes the CastService is shown in the *actors.taxi* tab below, and an example of the cast list returned is shown in the *actor-data.xml* tab.

Again, create a file called `actors.taxi` in the directory `taxi/src` in your project.

[tabs]
====
actors.taxi::
+
[source,taxi]
----
import flow.formats.Xml

@Xml model ActorList {
  item : Actor[] 
} 

model Actor { 
  id : ActorId inherits Int 
  name : ActorName inherits String
} 

service CastService { 
  @HttpOperation(url = "http://films-xml:80/film/{filmId}/cast", method = "GET") 
  operation fetchCastForFilm(@PathVariable("filmId") filmId : FilmId):ActorList
}
----
actor-data.xml::
+
[source,xml]
----
<List>
  <item>
    <id>34</id>
    <name>JUDY DEAN</name>
  </item>
  <item>
    <id>21</id>
    <name>ELVIS MARX</name>
  </item>
</List>
----
====

=== What connects it together

{short-product-name} can now link the services together - there's no need to write any integration code or resolvers as there is enough information contained in the schemas.

TIP: Use the *Services diagram* in {short-product-name}'s *Catalog* to view how everything links together.

[,taxi]
----
// The FilmId from the Film model...
model Film {
  id : FilmId inherits Int
  ...
}

// ... is used as an input to the fetchCastForFilm operation:
operation fetchCastForFilm(FilmId):ActorList
----

NOTE: More Taxi has been written here than normal because you're not working with the service's XSD directly (e.g., it wasn't available, or it didn't exist). If the services published XSDs or WSDLs, you could have leveraged those and only declared the Taxi scalars, such as `FilmId`.

== Step 4 - Write Data Queries

Next, using {short-product-name}'s *Query editor*, write a query using TaxiQL. 

=== Fetch the list of films

[,taxi]
----
// Just fetch the ActorList
find { FilmList }
----

Which returns:

[,json]
----
{
   "item": [
      {
         "id": 0,
         "title": "ACADEMY DINOSAUR",
         "yearReleased": 2005
      },
      {
         "id": 1,
         "title": "ACE GOLDFINGER",
         "yearReleased": 1975
      },
      // snip
   ]
}
----

=== Restructure the result

To remove the `item` wrapper (which is carried over from the XML format), change the query to just ask for a `Film[]`:

[,taxi]
----
find { FilmList } as Film[]
----

Which returns:

[,json]
----
[
  {
   "id": 0,
   "title": "ACADEMY DINOSAUR",
   "yearReleased": 2005
  },
  {
   "id": 1,
   "title": "ACE GOLDFINGER",
   "yearReleased": 1975
  }
]
----

=== Define a custom response object

You can define a data contract of the exact data you want back, specifying the field names you like,
with the data type indicating where the data is sourced from.
This means you are not bound to the source system's descriptions.

[,taxi]
----
find { FilmList } as (Film[]) -> {
    filmId : FilmId
    nameOfFilm : FilmTitle
} []
----

=== Link the Actor Service

To include data from the `CastService`, just ask for the actor information:

[,taxi]
----
find { FilmList } as (Film[]) -> {
    filmId : FilmId
    nameOfFilm : FilmTitle
    cast : Actor[]
} []
----

Which now gives us:

[,json]
----
{
   "filmId": 0,
   "nameOfFilm": "ACADEMY DINOSAUR",
   "cast": [
      {
         "id": 18,
         "name": "BOB FAWCETT"
      },
      {
         "id": 28,
         "name": "ALEC WAYNE"
      },
    //..snip
   ]
}
----

== Step 5 - Add the Awards Service

You can also define a schema and service for the awards information, which is returned in JSON.

The Taxi code that describes the AwardsService is shown in the *awards.taxi* tab below, and an example of the awards returned is shown in the *awards-data.json* tab.

You'll need to add this to your project by creating a file called `awards.taxi` in the directory `taxi/src`.

[tabs]
====
awards.taxi::
+
[source,taxi]
----
model Award { 
  title: AwardTitle inherits String
  yearWon: YearWon inherits Int
}

service AwardsService {
  @HttpOperation(url = "http://films-xml:80/film/{filmId}/awards", method = "GET")
  operation fetchAwardsForFilm(@PathVariable("filmId") filmId: FilmId): Award[]
}
----
awards-data.json::
+
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "title": "Best Makeup and Hairstyling", 
    "yearWon": 2020
  }, 
  { 
    "title": "Best Original Score", 
    "yearWon": 2020 
  }, 
  // snip\... 
]
----
====

=== Enrich your query

Finally, to include this awards data, you just add it to the query:

[,taxi]
----
find { FilmList } as (Film[]) -> {
  filmId: FilmId
  nameOfFilm: FilmTitle
  cast: Actor[]
  awards: Award[]
} []
----

Which gives us:

[,json]
----
{
   "filmId": 0,
   "nameOfFilm": "ACADEMY DINOSAUR",
   "cast" : [] // omitted
   "awards": [
      {
         "title": "Best Documentary Feature",
         "yearWon": 2020
      },
      {
         "title": "Best Supporting Actress",
         "yearWon": 2020
      },
   ]
}
----

== Step 6 - Publish your query

The following shows how to publish a query as a REST API, and as an endpoint using the UI.  

=== Publish a query as a REST API

Now that you have response data you're happy with, you can publish this query as a REST API.

. Wrap the query in a `+query { ... }+` block, and save it in your Taxi project
. Add an `+@HttpOperation(...)+` annotation

[tabs]
====
query.taxi::
+
[source,taxi]
----
@HttpOperation(url = '/api/q/filmsAndAwards', method = 'GET')
 query filmsAndAwards {
      find { FilmList } as (Film[]) -> {
          filmId : FilmId
          nameOfFilm : FilmTitle
          awards : Award[]
          cast : Actor[]
      } []
 }
----
====

Your query is now available at http://localhost:9021/api/q/filmsAndAwards

[,bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:9021/api/q/filmsAndAwards | jq
----

Which gives:

[,json]
----
[
  {
    "filmId": 0,
    "nameOfFilm": "ACADEMY DINOSAUR",
    "awards": [
      {
        "title": "Best Animated Feature",
        "yearWon": 2020
      },
      {
        "title": "Best Original Score for a Comedy",
        "yearWon": 2020
      },
      {
        "title": "Best Documentary Feature",
        "yearWon": 2020
      },
      // .... snip
    ]
  }
]
----

=== Publish a query using the UI 

To publish a query as an endpoint using the UI: 

* Choose *Query editor* and in the editor, write your query
* Click *Run* to make sure the query runs with no errors
* Click the *Save query to project* button, choose a project (this must be editable), give your query a name and then save it
* Click the *Publish endpoint* button and publish it as an HTTP or WebSocket endpoint, depending on the query
* Choose *Endpoints* and make sure the query is running (you can disable/enable the endpoint if necessary)

=== Stop the services

When you're done, you can stop the services by running:

[,bash]
----
docker compose down
----


== Wrap up and next steps

In this tutorial, you have:

* Created a new project
* Exposed XML services and modelled their responses
* Written a query stitching three services together
* Published the query as an HTTP service

= Generating code from Taxi
:description: A tutorial explaining how to generate Kotlin code from Taxi.

This tutorial explores generating code from your Taxi project. As your usage of Taxi scales, it's 
good practice to xref:describe-data-sources:tips-on-taxonomies.adoc#types-are-intended-for-sharing[extract your types into a standalone, shared taxonomy project].

However, many teams will want to adopt a code-first approach, generating their Service and API specs directly from code (we cover this in detail in our xref:guides:gen-taxi-from-code.adoc[Generating Taxi from code] tutorial.)

To help with this, Taxi supports generating code from Taxi.

// NOTE: This guide focuses on JVM languages. If you'd like support in your own language, please <a href={'https://join.slack.com/t/orbitalapi/shared_invite/zt-697laanr-DHGXXak5slqsY9DqwrkzHg'}>reach out to us</a>, and we'll build it for you. 

== Creating a Flow project

Follow the xref:deploy:development-deployments.adoc[Development Quickstart] to get your {short-product-name} server running and ready to build your models.

== Creating some types
Under the `src/` directory, create a file that contains our types. The name of the file doesn't matter (so long as it has a `.taxi` extension).

We'll generate the corresponding types from our xref:guides:gen-taxi-from-code.adoc[code-first tutorial].

```taxi types.taxi
type FilmId inherits Int
type FilmTitle inherits String
type ReviewScore inherits Int
type ReviewText inherits String
```

With this in place, we can run a Taxi build to verify that everything compiles. From the command line, in the same
directory as you created the project (where a `taxi.conf` file now sits), run the build command:

```bash
taxi build
```

At this point, you should see something like:

```bash
Taxi 1.54.0 @57be173 
Fetching dependencies for com.foo/films-api/0.1.0 
Compilation succeeded 
No sources were generated. Consider adding a source generator in the taxi.conf  
```

As the output suggests, no sources have been generated, as we haven't provided a code generation plugin.

== Generating Kotlin code
Update the `taxi.conf` file, to add a plugin to generate code for the JVM.  The Kotlin code generates
code suitable for both Java and Kotlin.

NOTE: The code generated from the Kotlin plugin is suitable for use in both Java and Kotlin projects.

```hocon taxi.conf
   name: com.foo/films-api
   version: 0.1.0
   sourceRoot: src/
   additionalSources: {}
   dependencies: {}
   plugins: {
       taxi/kotlin {}
   }
```

Now, running `taxi.build` will generate Kotlin code for us:

```bash
taxi build

Taxi 1.54.0 @57be173 
Fetching dependencies for com.foo/films-api/0.1.0 
Running generator @taxi/kotlin 
Generator @taxi/kotlin generated 5 files 
Compilation succeeded 
Wrote 5 files to /home/myname/dev/tmp/taxi-tutorial/dist 
```

The following files have been created:

== Generating Maven files
The last missing piece is a `pom.xml` to let us build this code with Maven.

To update, simply add a `maven` block into our `taxi/kotlin` plugin in the `taxi.conf` file.

```taxi taxi.conf
   name: com.foo/films-api
   version: 0.1.0
   sourceRoot: src/
   additionalSources: {}
   dependencies: {
   }
   plugins: {
       taxi/kotlin {
           maven {}
       }
   }
```

The Maven plugin is https://taxilang.org/taxi-cli/kotlin-plugin/#generating-a-maven-pomxml[very extensible], but we'll work with the defaults for now.

Note that adding in the Maven plugin means the build will now adopt Maven conventions. It's best to clear out our `dist` directory before building again.

```bash
rm -rf dist
taxi build
```

== Consuming in an application
The Kotlin plugin has generated code we can consume in our Java and Kotlin applications.

Using the Spring Boot application from our xref:guides:gen-taxi-from-code.adoc[Spring Boot example], we can update
our code to use the generated artefacts, in both our response object definitions, and our API definitions.

Kotlin::

data class FilmReview(
      val score: ReviewScore,
      val review: ReviewText
    )

    @GetMapping("/films/{filmId}/review")
    fun getFilmReview(
           @PathVariable("filmId") filmId: FilmId
        ): FilmReview {
        return FilmReview(
            score = Random.nextInt(1,5),
            review = listOf("Good","Bad","Meh").random()
        )
    }
----
Java::

[source,java]
----
import com.foo.TypeNames; // This class was generated  
    import lang.taxi.annotations.DataType;  
  
    // our domain classes can now be annotated:
    public class Film {
    
    @DataType(TypeNames.FilmId)
      private final Integer id;
    @DataType(TypeNames.FilmTitle)
      private final String title;
    
      // getters etc omitted.
    }

  
     // Or, to specify parameters into a service class:
     @RestController
     public class ReviewsService {
     
       @GetMapping("/films/{filmId}/review")
       public FilmReview getFilmReview(
               @PathVariable("filmId")
             @DataType(TypeNames.FilmId) int filmId
       ) {} // impl. omitted
     }

These annotations inform the Taxi code generator to use the correct Taxi type when generating Taxi from code.

== Summary
This tutorial has shown how to create a simple Taxi project, and generate Kotlin (including Java) and Maven code, ready to install and start consuming within your projects.

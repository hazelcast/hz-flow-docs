= Composing APIs and a Database
:description: A tutorial showing how to link a database and APIs.


This tutorial focuses on stitching together APIs and a database to create a custom API for our needs. Typically, you'd use this in a Backend-for-frontend (BFF) pattern.

This {lpn} demo takes place in a fictitious film studio. Our goal is to stitch together data about our Films catalog, along with data from REST APIs, like the reviews of each film, and where we can watch it.

== Our demo services

image:2architecture-overview.png[The architecture for this demo]

This demo deploys the following:

* A database exposing a catalog of films
* A REST Endpoint that returns which streaming services are playing each film
* A REST Endpoint that returns reviews for each film
* A REST Endpoint that resolves IDs
 ** Our services have different ID schemes - specifically the IDs used in our DB are not the same IDs used by our FilmReviews API. Therefore, we need to map one set of IDs to another

== Describing our data and services

First, we'll define a handful of Taxi types to describe the data returned from our services:

```taxi films.taxi
type StreamingProviderName inherits String
type StreamingProviderPrice inherits Decimal
type FilmId inherits Int
type Description inherits String
type Title inherits String
```

Then we'll embed those types in our REST APIs.

We've shown this approach in a few different ways, depending on your preference for describing APIs:

=== Spring Boot + Kotlin

We'll configure Spring Boot to auto-publish a schema. This is a great option for teams who like to generate specs from code. This requires a little more up-front setup, but this is a one-time activity.

==== Step 1 - Update taxi.conf

Update the `taxi.conf` file to add the Kotlin code generator:

```hocon taxi.conf
plugins: {
  taxi/kotlin: {
      maven: {
         groupId: "com.petflix"
         artifactId: "films"
        }
    }
}
```
==== Step 2 - Run the taxi build

Run the taxi build which generates Kotlin classes for all our types, and outputs them in the `dist` folder:

```terminal Terminal
taxi build
```

==== Step 3 - Add the dependency to our maven pom

Update the `pom.xml` file our newly created project:

```xml pom.xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.petflix</groupId>
    <artifact>films</artifact>
    <version>0.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

==== Step 4 - Add our type metadata to our response types

Update our data classes to use the new semantic types created in step 2:

```kotlin pom.xml
data class StreamingProvider(
    val name: StreamingProviderName,
    val pricePerMonth: StreamingProviderPrice
)
```

==== Step 5 - Add our type metadata to our services

Update our data classes to use the new semantic types created in step 2:

```kotlin pom.xml
@GetMapping("/films/{filmId}/streamingProviders")
fun whereCanIWatch(
  @PathVariable("filmId") filmId: FilmId
): StreamingProvider
```

== Publish our API specs
Now that the API specs have Taxi metadata, we can publish them to {short-product-name}:

=== OpenAPI and Taxi

[tabs]
====
workspace.conf (OpenAPI)::
+
[source,hocon]
----
file {
   projects = [
      {path: "taxi/taxi.conf"},
      {
         path: "services/api-docs.yaml",
         loader: {
            packageType: OpenApi
            identifier: {
               organisation: "com.petflix"
               name: "PetflixServices"
               version: "0.1.20"
            },
            defaultNamespace: "com.petflix"
         }
      }
   ]
}
----
workspace.conf (Taxi)::
+
[source,taxi]
----
file {
   projects = [
      {path: "taxi/taxi.conf"},
   ]
}
----

=== Spring Boot + Kotlin

Our Spring boot services are now self-describing, we just need to publish them on startup.

==== Step 1 - Add maven dependency

Update the `pom.xml` file to add the Kotlin code generator:

```xml pom.xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.flow</groupId>
    <artifact>schema-rsocket-publisher</artifact>
    <version>\${orbital.version}</version>
</dependency>
```
==== Step 2 - Generate and publish

Update our Spring Boot application to generate our schemas on startup and publish to {short-product-name}:

```kotlin App.kt
@Component
class RegisterSchemaOnStartup(
    @Value("\${server.port}")
    private val serverPort: String,
    @Value("\${spring.application.name}")
    private val appName: String
) {
  init {
    val publisher = SchemaPublisherService(
        appName,
        RSocketSchemaPublisherTransport(
            TcpAddress("localhost", 7655)
        )
    )
    publisher.publish(
        PackageMetadata.from("io.petflix.demos", appName),
        SpringTaxiGenerator.forBaseUrl("http://localhost:\${serverPort}")
            .forPackage(StreamingMoviesProvider::class.java)
            .generate()
    ).subscribe()
  }
 }
```

== Composing APIs
Our APIs are now described and published to {short-product-name}, so we can start writing queries to ask for data.

In the Query Editor, write a query to ask for data coming from the three APIs:

```taxi
find { Film[] } as {
    id : FilmId
    title : Title

    review: FilmReviewScore
    reviewText: ReviewText

    availableOn: StreamingProviderName
    price: StreamingProviderPrice
}[]
```

Notice that as you type, you'll get helpful code completion.

image:code-editing.gif[Auto completion]

Run this query, and you'll get the results back, linking together data from our database, and three different REST APIs.

=== Exploring the profiler

Click on the Profiler tab, and you'll see an architecture diagram, showing all
the services that were called for each field:

image:profiler-view.png[The profiler shows the services invoked to execute our query]

Note that:

* To fetch our `serviceName` and `price`, we passed data from the DB to a REST API
* To fetch the review data, we had to take a trip to an additional API to resolve the IDs

=== How does this work?

There's no resolver or glue code written here, so how does this all work?

{short-product-name} uses the types in our query (`FilmReviewScore`, `ReviewText`, etc), and looks up
the services that expose these values. It then builds an integration plan to load the required
data.

== Exposing a composite API

Now we have the data we want to expose, we can publish this on an API.

* First click *Save*
* In the popup, for the project, select `films`
* For the query name, enter `filmsAndReviews` (or any name you choose)
* Click *Save*

image:save-query.png[Saving a query writes it to disk in developer mode, so you can commit to Git]


If you take a look in the source code, a new file has appeared at `taxi/src/filmsAndReviews.taxi`.

Next, let's expose this saved query as an HTTP endpoint.

* In the top menu, click the 3-dots menu item
* Click *Publish query as HTTP Endpoint*
* In the popup, enter a URL for the query - eg: `films-and-reviews`
* Click *Update*
* Click *Save*

image:publish-as-http.gif[Publish your query as an HTTP endpoint, to consume from UIs]

Now, send a request to the endpoint you selected. As we're getting JSON back, we'll pipe it to `jq` so it's nicely formatted:

[,bash]
----
curl http://localhost:9021/api/q/films-and-reviews | jq
----

[,json]
----
  {
    "id": 904,
    "title": "TRAIN BUNCH",
    "review": 4.6,
    "reviewText": "This is not one of those awful dark, depressing films about an impending genetic apocalypse, although it could have easily been turned into that with a few minor tweaks. This is an entertaining romp, loaded with action, nostalgia and special effects.",
    "availableOn": "Netflix",
    "price": 9.99
  },
  {
    "id": 905,
    "title": "TRAINSPOTTING STRANGERS",
    "review": 3.9,
    "reviewText": "For a while it seems it wants to be the franchise’s ‘Mission: Impossible.’ Instead, it’s the anti–‘Top Gun: Maverick’.My co-worker Ali has one of these. He says it looks towering.",
    "availableOn": "Now TV",
    "price": 13.99
  },

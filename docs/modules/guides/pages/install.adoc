= Installing {short-product-name}
:description: A tutorial to get Taxi running locally.


This tutorial covers getting {long-product-name} and Taxi running locally in a developer environment.

== Prerequisites

Before you get started, you'll need the following:

* https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/[Docker] and Docker Compose (installed by default with Docker)
* https://sdkman.io/install[SDKMan] - a useful tool for installing SDKs and developer tools
* https://code.visualstudio.com/[VSCode] - optional, but we create dev tools for VSCode that improve the developer experience

== Installing Taxi

https://taxilang.org[Taxi] is a language for describing data sources, and how data relates. 
Its CLI has tooling for creating projects and running builds.

First, let's install Taxi:

[,console]
----
$ sdk install taxi

Downloading: taxi 1.42.0

In progress...

Installing: taxi 1.42.0
Done installing!

Setting taxi 1.42.0 as default.
----

Now running `taxi` should show the installed build:

[,bash]
----
$ taxi

Taxi 1.42.0 @7ebfab5
Usage: taxi [options] [command] [command options] Main options
----

=== Creating a new Taxi project

Create an empty directory, and run `taxi init`

[,bash]
----
$ mkdir flow-demo
$ cd flow-demo
$ taxi init
----

You'll be prompted with questions about the project group, name, version and src:

----
Project group (eg., com.acme): com.demo
Project name: hello-world
Project version [0.1.0]:
Source directory [src/]:
Creating project com.demo/hello-world v0.1.0 in directory /dev/flow-demo
Writing config to /dev/flow-demo/taxi.conf
Generating source directory at /dev/flow-demo/src
Finished
----

You now have an empty Taxi project.

Open VSCode to take a look around:

[,bash]
----
$ code .
----

== Launching {short-product-name}

Finally, let's launch {short-product-name}.

Taxi has a convenient command to launch a developer environment of {short-product-name}, which is preconfigured to the current project:

[,bash]
----
$ taxi flow
----

This downloads a `docker-compose.yml` file from https://start.flow.com/[start.flow.com], then runs `docker compose up`.
#Author's note - the link does not work.#

=== Live reload

The developer environment of {short-product-name} is configured with live reload, so any changes you make in your Taxi project are automatically picked up
and detected inside of {short-product-name}.

== Next steps

That's it! You're now running {short-product-name} locally, and have a brand new Taxi project ready to go.

Why not take one of the other tutorials for a spin, and build something locally.

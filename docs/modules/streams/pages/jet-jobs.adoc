= Jet jobs (publish streaming endpoints)
:description: A Jet job is created on publishing streaming endpoints:

== {short-product-name} Jet jobs
{short-product-name} uses Jet jobs when you create and enable streaming endpoints. These jobs are long-lived and run continuously in the background for each endpoint.    The Jet job is stopped when you disable the streaming endpoint.

xref:query:queries-as-endpoints.adoc[Publishing queries] describes how to create and publish queries as HTTP or WebSocket endpoints.

After creating a query, it is visible in the list of endpoints in the {short-product-name} UI under "Endpoints".

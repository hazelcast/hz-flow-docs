:description: Connect all your APIs and data sources dynamically, without writing integration code.

Welcome to {long-product-name}. 

{short-product-name} is a data gateway that automates integration for your microservices. Using {short-product-name}, you can automate the integration, transformation and discovery of data from different data sources (APIs, databases, message brokers) across your enterprise.

{short-product-name} integrates on-the-fly, automatically adjusting as your data sources change.

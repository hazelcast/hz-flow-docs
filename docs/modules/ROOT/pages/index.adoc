= Overview
:description: Connect all your APIs and data sources dynamically, without writing integration code.

Welcome to {long-product-name}. 

{short-product-name} is a data gateway that automates integration for your microservices. Using {short-product-name}, you can automate the integration, transformation and discovery of data from different data sources (APIs, databases, message brokers) across your enterprise.

{short-product-name} integrates on-the-fly, automatically adjusting as your data sources change.

This is powered by rich semantic schemas, which infer how data across your organization links together, and which automate the integration and discovery of data.
